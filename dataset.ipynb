      "an inherent difficulty which there is in all new principalities; for\n",
      "men change their rulers willingly, hoping to better themselves, and this\n",
      "hope induces them to take up arms against him who rules: wherein they\n",
      "are deceived, because they afterwards find by experience they have\n",
      "gone from bad to worse. This follows also on another natural and common\n",
      "necessity, which always causes a new prince to burden those who have\n",

      "forces, yet in entering a province one has always need of the goodwill\n",
      "of the natives.\n",
      "\n",
      "For these reasons Louis the Twelfth, King of France, quickly occupied\n",
      "Milan, and as quickly lost it; and to turn him out the first time it\n",
      "only needed Lodovico's own forces; because those who had opened the\n",

      "little reluctance, takes the opportunity of the rebellion to punish the\n",
      "delinquents, to clear out the suspects, and to strengthen himself in the\n",
      "weakest places. Thus to cause France to lose Milan the first time it was\n",
      "enough for the Duke Lodovico(*) to raise insurrections on the borders;\n",
      "but to cause him to lose it a second time it was necessary to bring\n",
      "the whole world against him, and that his armies should be defeated and\n",
      "driven out of Italy; which followed from the causes above mentioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "     (*) Duke Lodovico was Lodovico Moro, a son of Francesco\n",
      "     Sforza, who married Beatrice d'Este. He ruled over Milan\n",
      "     from 1494 to 1500, and died in 1510.\n",

      "Nevertheless Milan was taken from France both the first and the second\n",

      "to name those for the second, and to see what resources he had, and what\n",
      "any one in his situation would have had for maintaining himself more\n",
      "securely in his acquisition than did the King of France.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I say that those dominions which, when acquired, are added to an\n",
      "ancient state by him who acquires them, are either of the same country\n",
      "and language, or they are not. When they are, it is easier to hold them,\n",
      "especially when they have not been accustomed to self-government; and\n",
      "to hold them securely it is enough to have destroyed the family of the\n",
      "prince who was ruling them; because the two peoples, preserving in other\n",
      "things the old conditions, and not being unlike in customs, will live\n",
      "quietly together, as one has seen in Brittany, Burgundy, Gascony, and\n",
      "Normandy, which have been bound to France for so long a time: and,\n",
      "although there may be some difference in language, nevertheless the\n",
      "customs are alike, and the people will easily be able to get on amongst\n",
      "themselves. He who has annexed them, if he wishes to hold them, has only\n",
      "to bear in mind two considerations: the one, that the family of their\n",
      "former lord is extinguished; the other, that neither their laws nor\n",
      "their taxes are altered, so that in a very short time they will become\n",
      "entirely one body with the old principality.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when states are acquired in a country differing in language,\n",
      "customs, or laws, there are difficulties, and good fortune and great\n",
      "energy are needed to hold them, and one of the greatest and most real\n",
      "helps would be that he who has acquired them should go and reside there.\n",
      "This would make his position more secure and durable, as it has made\n",
      "that of the Turk in Greece, who, notwithstanding all the other measures\n",
      "taken by him for holding that state, if he had not settled there, would\n",
      "not have been able to keep it. Because, if one is on the spot, disorders\n",
      "are seen as they spring up, and one can quickly remedy them; but if one\n",
      "is not at hand, they are heard of only when they are great, and then one\n",
      "can no longer remedy them. Besides this, the country is not pillaged\n",
      "by your officials; the subjects are satisfied by prompt recourse to the\n",
      "prince; thus, wishing to be good, they have more cause to love him, and\n",
      "wishing to be otherwise, to fear him. He who would attack that state\n",
      "from the outside must have the utmost caution; as long as the prince\n",
      "resides there it can only be wrested from him with the greatest\n",
      "difficulty.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other and better course is to send colonies to one or two places,\n",
      "which may be as keys to that state, for it is necessary either to do\n",
      "this or else to keep there a great number of cavalry and infantry. A\n",
      "prince does not spend much on colonies, for with little or no expense he\n",
      "can send them out and keep them there, and he offends a minority only of\n",
      "the citizens from whom he takes lands and houses to give them to the new\n",
      "inhabitants; and those whom he offends, remaining poor and scattered,\n",
      "are never able to injure him; whilst the rest being uninjured are easily\n",
      "kept quiet, and at the same time are anxious not to err for fear it\n",
      "should happen to them as it has to those who have been despoiled. In\n",
      "conclusion, I say that these colonies are not costly, they are more\n",
      "faithful, they injure less, and the injured, as has been said, being\n",
      "poor and scattered, cannot hurt. Upon this, one has to remark that men\n",
      "ought either to be well treated or crushed, because they can avenge\n",
      "themselves of lighter injuries, of more serious ones they cannot;\n",
      "therefore the injury that is to be done to a man ought to be of such a\n",
      "kind that one does not stand in fear of revenge.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in maintaining armed men there in place of colonies one spends much\n",
      "more, having to consume on the garrison all the income from the\n",
      "state, so that the acquisition turns into a loss, and many more are\n",
      "exasperated, because the whole state is injured; through the shifting\n",
      "of the garrison up and down all become acquainted with hardship, and\n",
      "all become hostile, and they are enemies who, whilst beaten on their\n",
      "own ground, are yet able to do hurt. For every reason, therefore, such\n",
      "guards are as useless as a colony is useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, the prince who holds a country differing in the above respects\n",
      "ought to make himself the head and defender of his less powerful\n",
      "neighbours, and to weaken the more powerful amongst them, taking care\n",
      "that no foreigner as powerful as himself shall, by any accident, get\n",
      "a footing there; for it will always happen that such a one will be\n",
      "introduced by those who are discontented, either through excess of\n",
      "ambition or through fear, as one has seen already. The Romans were\n",
      "brought into Greece by the Aetolians; and in every other country where\n",
      "they obtained a footing they were brought in by the inhabitants. And the\n",
      "usual course of affairs is that, as soon as a powerful foreigner enters\n",
      "a country, all the subject states are drawn to him, moved by the hatred\n",
      "which they feel against the ruling power. So that in respect to those\n",
      "subject states he has not to take any trouble to gain them over to\n",
      "himself, for the whole of them quickly rally to the state which he has\n",
      "acquired there. He has only to take care that they do not get hold of\n",
      "too much power and too much authority, and then with his own forces, and\n",
      "with their goodwill, he can easily keep down the more powerful of them,\n",
      "so as to remain entirely master in the country. And he who does not\n",
      "properly manage this business will soon lose what he has acquired, and\n",
      "whilst he does hold it he will have endless difficulties and troubles.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Romans, in the countries which they annexed, observed closely these\n",
      "measures; they sent colonies and maintained friendly relations with(*)\n",
      "the minor powers, without increasing their strength; they kept down the\n",
      "greater, and did not allow any strong foreign powers to gain authority.\n",
      "Greece appears to me sufficient for an example. The Achaeans and\n",
      "Aetolians were kept friendly by them, the kingdom of Macedonia was\n",
      "humbled, Antiochus was driven out; yet the merits of the Achaeans and\n",
      "Aetolians never secured for them permission to increase their power, nor\n",
      "did the persuasions of Philip ever induce the Romans to be his friends\n",
      "without first humbling him, nor did the influence of Antiochus make them\n",
      "agree that he should retain any lordship over the country. Because the\n",
      "Romans did in these instances what all prudent princes ought to do,\n",
      "who have to regard not only present troubles, but also future ones, for\n",
      "which they must prepare with every energy, because, when foreseen, it is\n",
      "easy to remedy them; but if you wait until they approach, the medicine\n",
      "is no longer in time because the malady has become incurable; for it\n",
      "happens in this, as the physicians say it happens in hectic fever,\n",
      "that in the beginning of the malady it is easy to cure but difficult to\n",
      "detect, but in the course of time, not having been either detected or\n",
      "treated in the beginning, it becomes easy to detect but difficult to\n",
      "cure. Thus it happens in affairs of state, for when the evils that arise\n",
      "have been foreseen (which it is only given to a wise man to see), they\n",
      "can be quickly redressed, but when, through not having been foreseen,\n",
      "they have been permitted to grow in a way that every one can see them,\n",
      "there is no longer a remedy. Therefore, the Romans, foreseeing troubles,\n",
      "dealt with them at once, and, even to avoid a war, would not let them\n",
      "come to a head, for they knew that war is not to be avoided, but is only\n",
      "to be put off to the advantage of others; moreover they wished to fight\n",
      "with Philip and Antiochus in Greece so as not to have to do it in Italy;\n",
      "they could have avoided both, but this they did not wish; nor did that\n",
      "ever please them which is forever in the mouths of the wise ones of our\n",
      "time:--Let us enjoy the benefits of the time--but rather the benefits of\n",

      "was his intention to secure himself against them, and this he would have\n",
      "quickly accomplished had Alexander lived.\n",

      "Such was his line of action as to present affairs. But as to the future\n",

      "might not be friendly to him and might seek to take from him that which\n",
      "Alexander had given him, so he decided to act in four ways. Firstly, by\n",

      "to take away that pretext from the Pope. Secondly, by winning to himself\n",
      "all the gentlemen of Rome, so as to be able to curb the Pope with their\n",

      "that he could by his own measures resist the first shock. Of these four\n",
      "things, at the death of Alexander, he had accomplished three. For he had\n",

      "few had escaped; he had won over the Roman gentlemen, and he had the\n",
      "most numerous party in the college. And as to any fresh acquisition, he\n",
      "intended to become master of Tuscany, for he already possessed Perugia\n",

      "to study France (for the French were already driven out of the kingdom\n",
      "of Naples by the Spaniards, and in this way both were compelled to buy\n",
      "his goodwill), he pounced down upon Pisa. After this, Lucca and Siena\n",

      "of there being too many, whilst from the nobles he can secure himself,\n",
      "as they are few in number. The worst that a prince may expect from a\n",

      "whilst the soldiers loved the warlike prince who was bold, cruel, and\n",
      "rapacious, which qualities they were quite willing he should exercise\n",

      "avoid being hated by every one, and when they cannot compass this, they\n",
      "ought to endeavour with the utmost diligence to avoid the hatred of the\n",

      "1. Some princes, so as to hold securely the state, have disarmed their\n",
      "subjects; others have kept their subject towns distracted by factions;\n",

      "themselves out to gain over those whom they distrusted in the beginning\n",

      "arming them, those arms become yours, those men who were distrusted\n",
      "become faithful, and those who were faithful are kept so, and your\n",
      "subjects become your adherents. And whereas all subjects cannot be\n",
      "armed, yet when those whom you do arm are benefited, the others can be\n",
      "handled more freely, and this difference in their treatment, which they\n",
      "quite understand, makes the former your dependents, and the latter,\n",
      "considering it to be necessary that those who have the most danger and\n",

      "them, you at once offend them by showing that you distrust them, either\n",
      "for cowardice or for want of loyalty, and either of these opinions\n",
      "breeds hatred against you. And because you cannot remain unarmed, it\n",

      "acquires a new state, which he adds as a province to his old one, then\n",
      "it is necessary to disarm the men of that state, except those who have\n",
      "been his adherents in acquiring it; and these again, with time and\n",
      "opportunity, should be rendered soft and effeminate; and matters should\n",

      "your own soldiers who in your old state were living near you.\n",

      "3. Our forefathers, and those who were reckoned wise, were accustomed\n",
      "to say that it was necessary to hold Pistoia by factions and Pisa by\n",
      "fortresses; and with this idea they fostered quarrels in some of their\n",
      "tributary towns so as to keep possession of them the more easily.\n",
      "This may have been well enough in those times when Italy was in a way\n",
      "balanced, but I do not believe that it can be accepted as a precept\n",
      "for to-day, because I do not believe that factions can ever be of use;\n",
      "rather it is certain that when the enemy comes upon you in divided\n",
      "cities you are quickly lost, because the weakest party will always\n",
      "assist the outside forces and the other will not be able to resist.\n",
      "The Venetians, moved, as I believe, by the above reasons, fostered the\n",
      "Guelph and Ghibelline factions in their tributary cities; and although\n",
      "they never allowed them to come to bloodshed, yet they nursed these\n",
      "disputes amongst them, so that the citizens, distracted by their\n",
      "differences, should not unite against them. Which, as we saw, did not\n",
      "afterwards turn out as expected, because, after the rout at Vaila, one\n",
      "party at once took courage and seized the state. Such methods argue,\n",
      "therefore, weakness in the prince, because these factions will never be\n",
      "permitted in a vigorous principality; such methods for enabling one the\n",
      "more easily to manage subjects are only useful in times of peace, but if\n",

      "has a greater necessity to earn renown than an hereditary one, causes\n",
      "enemies to arise and form designs against him, in order that he may have\n",
      "the opportunity of overcoming them, and by them to mount higher, as by a\n",
      "ladder which his enemies have raised. For this reason many consider that\n",
      "a wise prince, when he has the opportunity, ought with craft to foster\n",
      "some animosity against himself, so that, having crushed it, his renown\n",
      "may rise higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Princes, especially new ones, have found more fidelity and assistance\n",
      "in those men who in the beginning of their rule were distrusted than\n",
      "among those who in the beginning were trusted. Pandolfo Petrucci, Prince\n",
      "of Siena, ruled his state more by those who had been distrusted than by\n",
      "others. But on this question one cannot speak generally, for it varies\n",
      "so much with the individual; I will only say this, that those men who\n",
      "at the commencement of a princedom have been hostile, if they are of\n",
      "a description to need assistance to support themselves, can always be\n",
      "gained over with the greatest ease, and they will be tightly held to\n",
      "serve the prince with fidelity, inasmuch as they know it to be very\n",
      "necessary for them to cancel by deeds the bad impression which he had\n",
      "formed of them; and thus the prince always extracts more profit from\n",
      "them than from those who, serving him in too much security, may neglect\n",
      "his affairs. And since the matter demands it, I must not fail to warn a\n",
      "prince, who by means of secret favours has acquired a new state, that he\n",
      "must well consider the reasons which induced those to favour him who\n",
      "did so; and if it be not a natural affection towards him, but only\n",
      "discontent with their government, then he will only keep them friendly\n",
      "with great trouble and difficulty, for it will be impossible to satisfy\n",
      "them. And weighing well the reasons for this in those examples which\n",
      "can be taken from ancient and modern affairs, we shall find that it is\n",
      "easier for the prince to make friends of those men who were contented\n",
      "under the former government, and are therefore his enemies, than of\n",
      "those who, being discontented with it, were favourable to him and\n",
      "encouraged him to seize it.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. It has been a custom with princes, in order to hold their states\n",
      "more securely, to build fortresses that may serve as a bridle and bit\n",
      "to those who might design to work against them, and as a place of refuge\n",
      "from a first attack. I praise this system because it has been made use\n",
      "of formerly. Notwithstanding that, Messer Nicolo Vitelli in our times\n",
      "has been seen to demolish two fortresses in Citta di Castello so that he\n",
      "might keep that state; Guido Ubaldo, Duke of Urbino, on returning to\n",
      "his dominion, whence he had been driven by Cesare Borgia, razed to the\n",
      "foundations all the fortresses in that province, and considered that\n",
      "without them it would be more difficult to lose it; the Bentivogli\n",
      "returning to Bologna came to a similar decision. Fortresses, therefore,\n",
      "are useful or not according to circumstances; if they do you good in one\n",
      "way they injure you in another. And this question can be reasoned thus:\n",
      "the prince who has more to fear from the people than from foreigners\n",
      "ought to build fortresses, but he who has more to fear from foreigners\n",
      "than from the people ought to leave them alone. The castle of Milan,\n",
      "built by Francesco Sforza, has made, and will make, more trouble for the\n",
      "house of Sforza than any other disorder in the state. For this reason\n",
      "the best possible fortress is--not to be hated by the people, because,\n",
      "although you may hold the fortresses, yet they will not save you if the\n",
      "people hate you, for there will never be wanting foreigners to assist\n",
      "a people who have taken arms against you. It has not been seen in our\n",
      "times that such fortresses have been of use to any prince, unless to the\n",
      "Countess of Forli,(*) when the Count Girolamo, her consort, was killed;\n",
      "for by that means she was able to withstand the popular attack and wait\n",
      "for assistance from Milan, and thus recover her state; and the posture\n",
      "of affairs was such at that time that the foreigners could not assist\n",
      "the people. But fortresses were of little value to her afterwards when\n",
      "Cesare Borgia attacked her, and when the people, her enemy, were allied\n",
      "with foreigners. Therefore, it would have been safer for her, both then\n",
      "and before, not to have been hated by the people than to have had the\n",
      "fortresses. All these things considered then, I shall praise him\n",
      "who builds fortresses as well as him who does not, and I shall blame\n",
      "whoever, trusting in them, cares little about being hated by the people.\n",

      "foremost king in Christendom; and if you will consider his deeds\n",
      "you will find them all great and some of them extraordinary. In the\n",
      "beginning of his reign he attacked Granada, and this enterprise was the\n",
      "foundation of his dominions. He did this quietly at first and without\n",

      "will entreat you to declare yourself with arms. And irresolute princes,\n",
      "to avoid present dangers, generally follow the neutral path, and are\n",
      "generally ruined. But when a prince declares himself gallantly in favour\n",
      "of one side, if the party with whom he allies himself conquers, although\n",
      "the victor may be powerful and may have him at his mercy, yet he is\n",

      "held for the duke, and which they captured by the following means. The\n",
      "castellan was fortifying the rock and causing timber to be taken there;\n",

      "Orsini, not only would not ally themselves, but sent Nicolo Machiavelli,\n",
      "their secretary, to offer shelter and assistance to the duke against\n",

      "everybody's expectation, his soldiers had at once gone over to the\n",
      "enemy and he found himself disarmed and war at his door. But recovering\n",
      "courage from the offers of the Florentines, he decided to temporize\n",
      "before fighting with the few soldiers that remained to him, and to\n",
      "negotiate for a reconciliation, and also to get assistance. This latter\n",
      "he obtained in two ways, by sending to the King of France for men and by\n",

      "any practices to make the insurgents understand that he wished every man\n",

      "came also to him five hundred French lancers, and although he found\n",
      "himself sufficiently strong to take vengeance on his enemies in open\n",
      "war, he considered that it would be safer and more advantageous\n",

      "again fled to Venice, having first destroyed all the fortresses in\n",

      "fortresses, which he did not think he could defend, should be held by\n",

      "his men throughout the Romagna, set out for Imola at the end of November\n",
      "together with his French men-at-arms: thence he went to Cesena, where he\n",

      "who had assembled with their men in the duchy of Urbino, as to the\n",
      "enterprise in which they should now take part; but nothing being\n",

      "wished to undertake an expedition against Tuscany they were ready; if\n",
      "he did not wish it, then they would besiege Sinigalia. To this the duke\n",
      "replied that he did not wish to enter into war with Tuscany, and thus\n",

      "to come there. This appeared a good opportunity to the duke, as, being\n",
      "invited by them, and not going of his own will, he would awaken no\n",
      "suspicions. And the more to reassure them, he allowed all the French\n",
      "men-at-arms who were with him in Lombardy to depart, except the hundred\n",
      "lancers under Mons. di Candales, his brother-in-law. He left Cesena\n",

      "cunning and cleverness he persuaded the Vitelli and Orsini to wait for\n",
      "him at Sinigalia, pointing out to them that any lack of compliance would\n",
      "cast a doubt upon the sincerity and permanency of the reconciliation,\n",
      "and that he was a man who wished to make use of the arms and councils of\n",
      "his friends. But Vitellozzo remained very stubborn, for the death of\n",
      "his brother warned him that he should not offend a prince and afterwards\n",
      "trust him; nevertheless, persuaded by Pagolo Orsini, whom the duke had\n",
      "corrupted with gifts and promises, he agreed to wait.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon this the duke, before his departure from Fano, which was to be\n",
      "on 30th December 1502, communicated his designs to eight of his most\n",
      "trusted followers, among whom were Don Michele and the Monsignor d'Euna,\n",
      "who was afterwards cardinal; and he ordered that, as soon as Vitellozzo,\n",
      "Pagolo Orsini, the Duke di Gravina, and Oliverotto should arrive, his\n",
      "followers in pairs should take them one by one, entrusting certain\n",
      "men to certain pairs, who should entertain them until they reached\n",
      "Sinigalia; nor should they be permitted to leave until they came to the\n",
      "duke's quarters, where they should be seized.\n",

      "there were more than two thousand cavalry and ten thousand footmen, to\n",
      "assemble by daybreak at the Metauro, a river five miles distant from\n",
      "Fano, and await him there. He found himself, therefore, on the last day\n",
      "of December at the Metauro with his men, and having sent a cavalcade\n",
      "of about two hundred horsemen before him, he then moved forward the\n",
      "infantry, whom he accompanied with the rest of the men-at-arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fano and Sinigalia are two cities of La Marca situated on the shore of\n",
      "the Adriatic Sea, fifteen miles distant from each other, so that he who\n",
      "goes towards Sinigalia has the mountains on his right hand, the bases\n",
      "of which are touched by the sea in some places. The city of Sinigalia is\n",
      "distant from the foot of the mountains a little more than a bow-shot\n",
      "and from the shore about a mile. On the side opposite to the city runs\n",
      "a little river which bathes that part of the walls looking towards Fano,\n",
      "facing the high road. Thus he who draws near to Sinigalia comes for\n",
      "a good space by road along the mountains, and reaches the river which\n",
      "passes by Sinigalia. If he turns to his left hand along the bank of it,\n",
      "and goes for the distance of a bow-shot, he arrives at a bridge which\n",
      "crosses the river; he is then almost abreast of the gate that leads into\n",
      "Sinigalia, not by a straight line, but transversely. Before this gate\n",
      "there stands a collection of houses with a square to which the bank of\n",
      "the river forms one side.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Vitelli and Orsini having received orders to wait for the duke, and\n",
      "to honour him in person, sent away their men to several castles distant\n",

      "of the duke; and they left in Sinigalia only Oliverotto and his band,\n",
      "which consisted of one thousand infantry and one hundred and fifty\n",
      "horsemen, who were quartered in the suburb mentioned above. Matters\n",
      "having been thus arranged, the Duke Valentino left for Sinigalia, and\n",
      "when the leaders of the cavalry reached the bridge they did not pass\n",
      "over, but having opened it, one portion wheeled towards the river and\n",

      "\n",
      "Vitellozzo, Pagolo, and the Duke di Gravina on mules, accompanied by a\n",
      "few horsemen, went towards the duke; Vitellozo, unarmed and wearing a\n",
      "cape lined with green, appeared very dejected, as if conscious of his\n",
      "approaching death--a circumstance which, in view of the ability of the\n",
      "man and his former fortune, caused some amazement. And it is said that\n",
      "when he parted from his men before setting out for Sinigalia to meet the\n",
      "duke he acted as if it were his last parting from them. He recommended\n",
      "his house and its fortunes to his captains, and advised his nephews that\n",
      "it was not the fortune of their house, but the virtues of their fathers\n",
      "that should be kept in mind. These three, therefore, came before\n",
      "the duke and saluted him respectfully, and were received by him with\n",
      "goodwill; they were at once placed between those who were commissioned\n",
      "to look after them.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the duke noticing that Oliverotto, who had remained with his band in\n",
      "Sinigalia, was missing--for Oliverotto was waiting in the square before\n",
      "his quarters near the river, keeping his men in order and drilling\n",
      "them--signalled with his eye to Don Michelle, to whom the care of\n",
      "Oliverotto had been committed, that he should take measures that\n",
      "Oliverotto should not escape. Therefore Don Michele rode off and joined\n",
      "Oliverotto, telling him that it was not right to keep his men out of\n",
      "their quarters, because these might be taken up by the men of the duke;\n",
      "and he advised him to send them at once to their quarters and to come\n",
      "himself to meet the duke. And Oliverotto, having taken this advice, came\n",
      "before the duke, who, when he saw him, called to him; and Oliverotto,\n",
      "having made his obeisance, joined the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the whole party entered Sinigalia, dismounted at the duke's quarters,\n",
      "and went with him into a secret chamber, where the duke made them\n",
      "prisoners; he then mounted on horseback, and issued orders that the men\n",
      "of Oliverotto and the Orsini should be stripped of their arms. Those of\n",
      "Oliverotto, being at hand, were quickly settled, but those of the Orsini\n",
      "and Vitelli, being at a distance, and having a presentiment of the\n",
      "destruction of their masters, had time to prepare themselves, and\n",
      "bearing in mind the valour and discipline of the Orsinian and Vitellian\n",
      "houses, they stood together against the hostile forces of the country\n",
      "and saved themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the duke's soldiers, not being content with having pillaged the\n",
      "men of Oliverotto, began to sack Sinigalia, and if the duke had\n",
      "not repressed this outrage by killing some of them they would have\n",
      "completely sacked it. Night having come and the tumult being silenced,\n",
      "the duke prepared to kill Vitellozzo and Oliverotto; he led them into\n",
      "a room and caused them to be strangled. Neither of them used words in\n",
      "keeping with their past lives: Vitellozzo prayed that he might ask of\n",
      "the pope full pardon for his sins; Oliverotto cringed and laid the blame\n",
      "for all injuries against the duke on Vitellozzo. Pagolo and the Duke di\n",
      "Gravina Orsini were kept alive until the duke heard from Rome that the\n",

      "Messer Jacopo da Santa Croce. After which news, on 18th January 1502, in\n",

      "It appears, dearest Zanobi and Luigi, a wonderful thing to those who\n",
      "have considered the matter, that all men, or the larger number of them,\n",
      "who have performed great deeds in the world, and excelled all others in\n",
      "their day, have had their birth and beginning in baseness and obscurity;\n",
      "or have been aggrieved by Fortune in some outrageous way. They have\n",
      "either been exposed to the mercy of wild beasts, or they have had so\n",
      "mean a parentage that in shame they have given themselves out to be\n",
      "sons of Jove or of some other deity. It would be wearisome to relate who\n",
      "these persons may have been because they are well known to everybody,\n",
      "and, as such tales would not be particularly edifying to those who read\n",
      "them, they are omitted. I believe that these lowly beginnings of great\n",

      "men owe much to her and little to wisdom, because she begins to show\n",
      "her hand when wisdom can really take no part in their career: thus all\n",
      "success must be attributed to her. Castruccio Castracani of Lucca was\n",
      "one of those men who did great deeds, if he is measured by the times in\n",
      "which he lived and the city in which he was born; but, like many others,\n",
      "he was neither fortunate nor distinguished in his birth, as the course\n",
      "of this history will show. It appeared to be desirable to recall his\n",
      "memory, because I have discerned in him such indications of valour and\n",
      "fortune as should make him a great exemplar to men. I think also that\n",
      "I ought to call your attention to his actions, because you of all men I\n",
      "know delight most in noble deeds.\n",
      "\n",
      "The family of Castracani was formerly numbered among the noble families\n",
      "of Lucca, but in the days of which I speak it had somewhat fallen in\n",
      "estate, as so often happens in this world. To this family was born a son\n",
      "Antonio, who became a priest of the order of San Michele of Lucca, and\n",
      "for this reason was honoured with the title of Messer Antonio. He had an\n",
      "only sister, who had been married to Buonaccorso Cenami, but Buonaccorso\n",
      "dying she became a widow, and not wishing to marry again went to live\n",
      "with her brother. Messer Antonio had a vineyard behind the house where\n",
      "he resided, and as it was bounded on all sides by gardens, any person\n",
      "could have access to it without difficulty. One morning, shortly after\n",
      "sunrise, Madonna Dianora, as the sister of Messer Antonio was called,\n",
      "had occasion to go into the vineyard as usual to gather herbs for\n",
      "seasoning the dinner, and hearing a slight rustling among the leaves\n",
      "of a vine she turned her eyes in that direction, and heard something\n",
      "resembling the cry of an infant. Whereupon she went towards it, and saw\n",
      "the hands and face of a baby who was lying enveloped in the leaves and\n",
      "who seemed to be crying for its mother. Partly wondering and partly\n",
      "fearing, yet full of compassion, she lifted it up and carried it to\n",
      "the house, where she washed it and clothed it with clean linen as is\n",
      "customary, and showed it to Messer Antonio when he returned home. When\n",
      "he heard what had happened and saw the child he was not less surprised\n",
      "or compassionate than his sister. They discussed between themselves\n",
      "what should be done, and seeing that he was priest and that she had no\n",
      "children, they finally determined to bring it up. They had a nurse for\n",
      "it, and it was reared and loved as if it were their own child. They\n",
      "baptized it, and gave it the name of Castruccio after their father. As\n",
      "the years passed Castruccio grew very handsome, and gave evidence of\n",
      "wit and discretion, and learnt with a quickness beyond his years those\n",
      "lessons which Messer Antonio imparted to him. Messer Antonio intended\n",
      "to make a priest of him, and in time would have inducted him into his\n",
      "canonry and other benefices, and all his instruction was given with\n",
      "this object; but Antonio discovered that the character of Castruccio was\n",
      "quite unfitted for the priesthood. As soon as Castruccio reached the\n",
      "age of fourteen he began to take less notice of the chiding of Messer\n",
      "Antonio and Madonna Dianora and no longer to fear them; he left\n",
      "off reading ecclesiastical books, and turned to playing with arms,\n",
      "delighting in nothing so much as in learning their uses, and in running,\n",
      "leaping, and wrestling with other boys. In all exercises he far excelled\n",
      "his companions in courage and bodily strength, and if at any time he did\n",
      "turn to books, only those pleased him which told of wars and the mighty\n",

      "Ghibelline was the valued leader of that party in Lucca. This gentleman\n",
      "resided in Lucca and was accustomed to assemble with others most\n",
      "mornings and evenings under the balcony of the Podesta, which is at the\n",
      "top of the square of San Michele, the finest square in Lucca, and he had\n",
      "often seen Castruccio taking part with other children of the street\n",
      "in those games of which I have spoken. Noticing that Castruccio far\n",
      "excelled the other boys, and that he appeared to exercise a royal\n",
      "authority over them, and that they loved and obeyed him, Messer\n",
      "Francesco became greatly desirous of learning who he was. Being informed\n",
      "of the circumstances of the bringing up of Castruccio he felt a greater\n",
      "desire to have him near to him. Therefore he called him one day and\n",
      "asked him whether he would more willingly live in the house of a\n",
      "gentleman, where he would learn to ride horses and use arms, or in\n",
      "the house of a priest, where he would learn nothing but masses and\n",
      "the services of the Church. Messer Francesco could see that it pleased\n",
      "Castruccio greatly to hear horses and arms spoken of, even though\n",
      "he stood silent, blushing modestly; but being encouraged by Messer\n",
      "Francesco to speak, he answered that, if his master were agreeable,\n",
      "nothing would please him more than to give up his priestly studies and\n",
      "take up those of a soldier. This reply delighted Messer Francesco, and\n",
      "in a very short time he obtained the consent of Messer Antonio, who was\n",
      "driven to yield by his knowledge of the nature of the lad, and the fear\n",
      "that he would not be able to hold him much longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus Castruccio passed from the house of Messer Antonio the priest\n",
      "to the house of Messer Francesco Guinigi the soldier, and it was\n",
      "astonishing to find that in a very short time he manifested all that\n",
      "virtue and bearing which we are accustomed to associate with a true\n",
      "gentleman. In the first place he became an accomplished horseman, and\n",
      "could manage with ease the most fiery charger, and in all jousts and\n",
      "tournaments, although still a youth, he was observed beyond all others,\n",
      "and he excelled in all exercises of strength and dexterity. But what\n",
      "enhanced so much the charm of these accomplishments, was the delightful\n",
      "modesty which enabled him to avoid offence in either act or word to\n",
      "others, for he was deferential to the great men, modest with his equals,\n",
      "and courteous to his inferiors. These gifts made him beloved, not only\n",
      "by all the Guinigi family, but by all Lucca. When Castruccio had reached\n",
      "his eighteenth year, the Ghibellines were driven from Pavia by the\n",
      "Guelphs, and Messer Francesco was sent by the Visconti to assist the\n",
      "Ghibellines, and with him went Castruccio, in charge of his forces.\n",
      "Castruccio gave ample proof of his prudence and courage in this\n",
      "expedition, acquiring greater reputation than any other captain, and\n",
      "his name and fame were known, not only in Pavia, but throughout all\n",
      "Lombardy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Castruccio, having returned to Lucca in far higher estimation than he\n",
      "left it, did not omit to use all the means in his power to gain as many\n",
      "friends as he could, neglecting none of those arts which are necessary\n",
      "for that purpose. About this time Messer Francesco died, leaving a son\n",
      "thirteen years of age named Pagolo, and having appointed Castruccio\n",
      "to be his son's tutor and administrator of his estate. Before he died\n",
      "Francesco called Castruccio to him, and prayed him to show Pagolo that\n",
      "goodwill which he (Francesco) had always shown to HIM, and to render to\n",
      "the son the gratitude which he had not been able to repay to the father.\n",
      "Upon the death of Francesco, Castruccio became the governor and tutor of\n",
      "Pagolo, which increased enormously his power and position, and created\n",
      "a certain amount of envy against him in Lucca in place of the former\n",
      "universal goodwill, for many men suspected him of harbouring tyrannical\n",
      "intentions. Among these the leading man was Giorgio degli Opizi, the\n",
      "head of the Guelph party. This man hoped after the death of Messer\n",
      "Francesco to become the chief man in Lucca, but it seemed to him that\n",
      "Castruccio, with the great abilities which he already showed, and\n",
      "holding the position of governor, deprived him of his opportunity;\n",
      "therefore he began to sow those seeds which should rob Castruccio of his\n",
      "eminence. Castruccio at first treated this with scorn, but afterwards\n",
      "he grew alarmed, thinking that Messer Giorgio might be able to bring\n",
      "him into disgrace with the deputy of King Ruberto of Naples and have him\n",
      "driven out of Lucca.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lord of Pisa at that time was Uguccione of the Faggiuola of Arezzo,\n",
      "who being in the first place elected their captain afterwards became\n",
      "their lord. There resided in Paris some exiled Ghibellines from Lucca,\n",
      "with whom Castruccio held communications with the object of effecting\n",
      "their restoration by the help of Uguccione. Castruccio also brought into\n",
      "his plans friends from Lucca who would not endure the authority of the\n",
      "Opizi. Having fixed upon a plan to be followed, Castruccio cautiously\n",
      "fortified the tower of the Onesti, filling it with supplies and\n",
      "munitions of war, in order that it might stand a siege for a few days\n",
      "in case of need. When the night came which had been agreed upon with\n",
      "Uguccione, who had occupied the plain between the mountains and\n",
      "Pisa with many men, the signal was given, and without being observed\n",
      "Uguccione approached the gate of San Piero and set fire to the\n",
      "portcullis. Castruccio raised a great uproar within the city, calling\n",
      "the people to arms and forcing open the gate from his side. Uguccione\n",
      "entered with his men, poured through the town, and killed Messer Giorgio\n",
      "with all his family and many of his friends and supporters. The governor\n",
      "was driven out, and the government reformed according to the wishes of\n",
      "Uguccione, to the detriment of the city, because it was found that more\n",
      "than one hundred families were exiled at that time. Of those who\n",
      "fled, part went to Florence and part to Pistoia, which city was the\n",
      "headquarters of the Guelph party, and for this reason it became most\n",
      "hostile to Uguccione and the Lucchese.\n",
      "\n",
      "As it now appeared to the Florentines and others of the Guelph party\n",
      "that the Ghibellines absorbed too much power in Tuscany, they determined\n",
      "to restore the exiled Guelphs to Lucca. They assembled a large army in\n",
      "the Val di Nievole, and seized Montecatini; from thence they marched to\n",
      "Montecarlo, in order to secure the free passage into Lucca. Upon this\n",
      "Uguccione assembled his Pisan and Lucchese forces, and with a number\n",
      "of German cavalry which he drew out of Lombardy, he moved against\n",
      "the quarters of the Florentines, who upon the appearance of the enemy\n",
      "withdrew from Montecarlo, and posted themselves between Montecatini and\n",
      "Pescia. Uguccione now took up a position near to Montecarlo, and within\n",
      "about two miles of the enemy, and slight skirmishes between the horse\n",
      "of both parties were of daily occurrence. Owing to the illness of\n",
      "Uguccione, the Pisans and Lucchese delayed coming to battle with the\n",
      "enemy. Uguccione, finding himself growing worse, went to Montecarlo to\n",
      "be cured, and left the command of the army in the hands of Castruccio.\n",
      "This change brought about the ruin of the Guelphs, who, thinking\n",
      "that the hostile army having lost its captain had lost its head, grew\n",
      "over-confident. Castruccio observed this, and allowed some days to pass\n",
      "in order to encourage this belief; he also showed signs of fear, and\n",
      "did not allow any of the munitions of the camp to be used. On the other\n",
      "side, the Guelphs grew more insolent the more they saw these evidences\n",
      "of fear, and every day they drew out in the order of battle in front\n",
      "of the army of Castruccio. Presently, deeming that the enemy was\n",
      "sufficiently emboldened, and having mastered their tactics, he decided\n",
      "to join battle with them. First he spoke a few words of encouragement to\n",
      "his soldiers, and pointed out to them the certainty of victory if they\n",
      "would but obey his commands. Castruccio had noticed how the enemy had\n",
      "placed all his best troops in the centre of the line of battle, and his\n",
      "less reliable men on the wings of the army; whereupon he did exactly\n",
      "the opposite, putting his most valiant men on the flanks, while those\n",
      "on whom he could not so strongly rely he moved to the centre. Observing\n",
      "this order of battle, he drew out of his lines and quickly came in sight\n",
      "of the hostile army, who, as usual, had come in their insolence to defy\n",
      "him. He then commanded his centre squadrons to march slowly, whilst\n",
      "he moved rapidly forward those on the wings. Thus, when they came into\n",
      "contact with the enemy, only the wings of the two armies became engaged,\n",
      "whilst the center battalions remained out of action, for these two\n",
      "portions of the line of battle were separated from each other by a long\n",
      "interval and thus unable to reach each other. By this expedient the more\n",
      "valiant part of Castruccio's men were opposed to the weaker part of the\n",
      "enemy's troops, and the most efficient men of the enemy were disengaged;\n",
      "and thus the Florentines were unable to fight with those who were\n",
      "arrayed opposite to them, or to give any assistance to their own flanks.\n",
      "So, without much difficulty, Castruccio put the enemy to flight on\n",
      "both flanks, and the centre battalions took to flight when they found\n",
      "themselves exposed to attack, without having a chance of displaying\n",
      "their valour. The defeat was complete, and the loss in men very heavy,\n",
      "there being more than ten thousand men killed with many officers and\n",
      "knights of the Guelph party in Tuscany, and also many princes who had\n",
      "come to help them, among whom were Piero, the brother of King Ruberto,\n",
      "and Carlo, his nephew, and Filippo, the lord of Taranto. On the part of\n",
      "Castruccio the loss did not amount to more than three hundred men, among\n",
      "whom was Francesco, the son of Uguccione, who, being young and rash, was\n",
      "killed in the first onset.\n",
      "\n",
      "This victory so greatly increased the reputation of Castruccio that\n",
      "Uguccione conceived some jealousy and suspicion of him, because it\n",
      "appeared to Uguccione that this victory had given him no increase of\n",
      "power, but rather than diminished it. Being of this mind, he only waited\n",
      "for an opportunity to give effect to it. This occurred on the death of\n",
      "Pier Agnolo Micheli, a man of great repute and abilities in Lucca, the\n",
      "murderer of whom fled to the house of Castruccio for refuge. On the\n",
      "sergeants of the captain going to arrest the murderer, they were driven\n",
      "off by Castruccio, and the murderer escaped. This affair coming to\n",
      "the knowledge of Uguccione, who was then at Pisa, it appeared to him a\n",
      "proper opportunity to punish Castruccio. He therefore sent for his\n",
      "son Neri, who was the governor of Lucca, and commissioned him to take\n",
      "Castruccio prisoner at a banquet and put him to death. Castruccio,\n",
      "fearing no evil, went to the governor in a friendly way, was entertained\n",
      "at supper, and then thrown into prison. But Neri, fearing to put him to\n",
      "death lest the people should be incensed, kept him alive, in order to\n",
      "hear further from his father concerning his intentions. Ugucionne cursed\n",
      "the hesitation and cowardice of his son, and at once set out from Pisa\n",
      "to Lucca with four hundred horsemen to finish the business in his own\n",
      "way; but he had not yet reached the baths when the Pisans rebelled and\n",
      "put his deputy to death and created Count Gaddo della Gherardesca their\n",
      "lord. Before Uguccione reached Lucca he heard of the occurrences at\n",
      "Pisa, but it did not appear wise to him to turn back, lest the Lucchese\n",
      "with the example of Pisa before them should close their gates against\n",
      "him. But the Lucchese, having heard of what had happened at Pisa,\n",
      "availed themselves of this opportunity to demand the liberation of\n",
      "Castruccio, notwithstanding that Uguccione had arrived in their city.\n",
      "They first began to speak of it in private circles, afterwards openly\n",
      "in the squares and streets; then they raised a tumult, and with arms in\n",
      "their hands went to Uguccione and demanded that Castruccio should be\n",
      "set at liberty. Uguccione, fearing that worse might happen, released him\n",
      "from prison. Whereupon Castruccio gathered his friends around him, and\n",
      "with the help of the people attacked Uguccione; who, finding he had no\n",
      "resource but in flight, rode away with his friends to Lombardy, to the\n",
      "lords of Scale, where he died in poverty.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Castruccio from being a prisoner became almost a prince in Lucca,\n",
      "and he carried himself so discreetly with his friends and the people\n",
      "that they appointed him captain of their army for one year. Having\n",
      "obtained this, and wishing to gain renown in war, he planned the\n",
      "recovery of the many towns which had rebelled after the departure of\n",
      "Uguccione, and with the help of the Pisans, with whom he had concluded a\n",
      "treaty, he marched to Serezzana. To capture this place he constructed a\n",
      "fort against it, which is called to-day Zerezzanello; in the course of\n",
      "two months Castruccio captured the town. With the reputation gained\n",
      "at that siege, he rapidly seized Massa, Carrara, and Lavenza, and in\n",
      "a short time had overrun the whole of Lunigiana. In order to close the\n",
      "pass which leads from Lombardy to Lunigiana, he besieged Pontremoli and\n",
      "wrested it from the hands of Messer Anastagio Palavicini, who was the\n",
      "lord of it. After this victory he returned to Lucca, and was welcomed by\n",
      "the whole people. And now Castruccio, deeming it imprudent any longer to\n",
      "defer making himself a prince, got himself created the lord of Lucca\n",
      "by the help of Pazzino del Poggio, Puccinello dal Portico, Francesco\n",
      "Boccansacchi, and Cecco Guinigi, all of whom he had corrupted; and he\n",
      "was afterwards solemnly and deliberately elected prince by the people.\n",
      "At this time Frederick of Bavaria, the King of the Romans, came into\n",
      "Italy to assume the Imperial crown, and Castruccio, in order that\n",
      "he might make friends with him, met him at the head of five hundred\n",
      "horsemen. Castruccio had left as his deputy in Lucca, Pagolo Guinigi,\n",
      "who was held in high estimation, because of the people's love for\n",
      "the memory of his father. Castruccio was received in great honour by\n",
      "Frederick, and many privileges were conferred upon him, and he was\n",
      "appointed the emperor's lieutenant in Tuscany. At this time the Pisans\n",
      "were in great fear of Gaddo della Gherardesca, whom they had driven out\n",
      "of Pisa, and they had recourse for assistance to Frederick. Frederick\n",
      "created Castruccio the lord of Pisa, and the Pisans, in dread of the\n",
      "Guelph party, and particularly of the Florentines, were constrained to\n",
      "accept him as their lord.\n",
      "\n",
      "Frederick, having appointed a governor in Rome to watch his Italian\n",
      "affairs, returned to Germany. All the Tuscan and Lombardian Ghibellines,\n",
      "who followed the imperial lead, had recourse to Castruccio for help\n",
      "and counsel, and all promised him the governorship of his country,\n",
      "if enabled to recover it with his assistance. Among these exiles were\n",
      "Matteo Guidi, Nardo Scolari, Lapo Uberti, Gerozzo Nardi, and Piero\n",
      "Buonaccorsi, all exiled Florentines and Ghibellines. Castruccio had the\n",
      "secret intention of becoming the master of all Tuscany by the aid of\n",
      "these men and of his own forces; and in order to gain greater weight\n",
      "in affairs, he entered into a league with Messer Matteo Visconti, the\n",
      "Prince of Milan, and organized for him the forces of his city and the\n",
      "country districts. As Lucca had five gates, he divided his own country\n",
      "districts into five parts, which he supplied with arms, and enrolled the\n",
      "men under captains and ensigns, so that he could quickly bring into the\n",
      "field twenty thousand soldiers, without those whom he could summon to\n",
      "his assistance from Pisa. While he surrounded himself with these forces\n",
      "and allies, it happened at Messer Matteo Visconti was attacked by\n",
      "the Guelphs of Piacenza, who had driven out the Ghibellines with the\n",
      "assistance of a Florentine army and the King Ruberto. Messer Matteo\n",
      "called upon Castruccio to invade the Florentines in their own\n",
      "territories, so that, being attacked at home, they should be compelled\n",
      "to draw their army out of Lombardy in order to defend themselves.\n",
      "Castruccio invaded the Valdarno, and seized Fucecchio and San Miniato,\n",
      "inflicting immense damage upon the country. Whereupon the Florentines\n",
      "recalled their army, which had scarcely reached Tuscany, when Castruccio\n",
      "was forced by other necessities to return to Lucca.\n",
      "\n",
      "There resided in the city of Lucca the Poggio family, who were so\n",
      "powerful that they could not only elevate Castruccio, but even advance\n",
      "him to the dignity of prince; and it appearing to them they had not\n",
      "received such rewards for their services as they deserved, they incited\n",
      "other families to rebel and to drive Castruccio out of Lucca. They found\n",
      "their opportunity one morning, and arming themselves, they set upon the\n",
      "lieutenant whom Castruccio had left to maintain order and killed him.\n",
      "They endeavoured to raise the people in revolt, but Stefano di Poggio, a\n",
      "peaceable old man who had taken no hand in the rebellion, intervened and\n",
      "compelled them by his authority to lay down their arms; and he offered\n",
      "to be their mediator with Castruccio to obtain from him what\n",
      "they desired. Therefore they laid down their arms with no greater\n",
      "intelligence than they had taken them up. Castruccio, having heard\n",
      "the news of what had happened at Lucca, at once put Pagolo Guinigi\n",
      "in command of the army, and with a troop of cavalry set out for home.\n",
      "Contrary to his expectations, he found the rebellion at an end, yet he\n",
      "posted his men in the most advantageous places throughout the city. As\n",
      "it appeared to Stefano that Castruccio ought to be very much obliged to\n",
      "him, he sought him out, and without saying anything on his own behalf,\n",
      "for he did not recognize any need for doing so, he begged Castruccio to\n",
      "pardon the other members of his family by reason of their youth, their\n",
      "former friendships, and the obligations which Castruccio was under to\n",
      "their house. To this Castruccio graciously responded, and begged Stefano\n",
      "to reassure himself, declaring that it gave him more pleasure to find\n",
      "the tumult at an end than it had ever caused him anxiety to hear of its\n",
      "inception. He encouraged Stefano to bring his family to him, saying\n",
      "that he thanked God for having given him the opportunity of showing his\n",
      "clemency and liberality. Upon the word of Stefano and Castruccio they\n",
      "surrendered, and with Stefano were immediately thrown into prison and\n",
      "put to death. Meanwhile the Florentines had recovered San Miniato,\n",
      "whereupon it seemed advisable to Castruccio to make peace, as it did not\n",
      "appear to him that he was sufficiently secure at Lucca to leave him.\n",
      "He approached the Florentines with the proposal of a truce, which they\n",
      "readily entertained, for they were weary of the war, and desirous of\n",
      "getting rid of the expenses of it. A treaty was concluded with them for\n",
      "two years, by which both parties agreed to keep the conquests they had\n",
      "made. Castruccio thus released from this trouble, turned his attention\n",
      "to affairs in Lucca, and in order that he should not again be subject to\n",
      "the perils from which he had just escaped, he, under various pretences\n",
      "and reasons, first wiped out all those who by their ambition might\n",
      "aspire to the principality; not sparing one of them, but depriving them\n",
      "of country and property, and those whom he had in his hands of life\n",
      "also, stating that he had found by experience that none of them were to\n",
      "be trusted. Then for his further security he raised a fortress in Lucca\n",
      "with the stones of the towers of those whom he had killed or hunted out\n",
      "of the state.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whilst Castruccio made peace with the Florentines, and strengthened his\n",
      "position in Lucca, he neglected no opportunity, short of open war, of\n",
      "increasing his importance elsewhere. It appeared to him that if he could\n",
      "get possession of Pistoia, he would have one foot in Florence, which was\n",
      "his great desire. He, therefore, in various ways made friends with\n",
      "the mountaineers, and worked matters so in Pistoia that both parties\n",
      "confided their secrets to him. Pistoia was divided, as it always had\n",
      "been, into the Bianchi and Neri parties; the head of the Bianchi was\n",
      "Bastiano di Possente, and of the Neri, Jacopo da Gia. Each of these men\n",
      "held secret communications with Castruccio, and each desired to drive\n",
      "the other out of the city; and, after many threatenings, they came to\n",
      "blows. Jacopo fortified himself at the Florentine gate, Bastiano at that\n",
      "of the Lucchese side of the city; both trusted more in Castruccio than\n",
      "in the Florentines, because they believed that Castruccio was far more\n",
      "ready and willing to fight than the Florentines, and they both sent to\n",
      "him for assistance. He gave promises to both, saying to Bastiano that he\n",
      "would come in person, and to Jacopo that he would send his pupil, Pagolo\n",
      "Guinigi. At the appointed time he sent forward Pagolo by way of Pisa,\n",
      "and went himself direct to Pistoia; at midnight both of them met outside\n",
      "the city, and both were admitted as friends. Thus the two leaders\n",
      "entered, and at a signal given by Castruccio, one killed Jacopo da Gia,\n",
      "and the other Bastiano di Possente, and both took prisoners or killed\n",
      "the partisans of either faction. Without further opposition Pistoia\n",
      "passed into the hands of Castruccio, who, having forced the Signoria to\n",
      "leave the palace, compelled the people to yield obedience to him,\n",
      "making them many promises and remitting their old debts. The countryside\n",
      "flocked to the city to see the new prince, and all were filled with hope\n",
      "and quickly settled down, influenced in a great measure by his great\n",
      "valour.\n",
      "\n",
      "About this time great disturbances arose in Rome, owing to the dearness\n",
      "of living which was caused by the absence of the pontiff at Avignon. The\n",
      "German governor, Enrico, was much blamed for what happened--murders and\n",
      "tumults following each other daily, without his being able to put an end\n",
      "to them. This caused Enrico much anxiety lest the Romans should call\n",
      "in Ruberto, the King of Naples, who would drive the Germans out of the\n",
      "city, and bring back the Pope. Having no nearer friend to whom he could\n",
      "apply for help than Castruccio, he sent to him, begging him not only\n",
      "to give him assistance, but also to come in person to Rome. Castruccio\n",
      "considered that he ought not to hesitate to render the emperor this\n",
      "service, because he believed that he himself would not be safe if at any\n",
      "time the emperor ceased to hold Rome. Leaving Pagolo Guinigi in command\n",
      "at Lucca, Castruccio set out for Rome with six hundred horsemen, where\n",
      "he was received by Enrico with the greatest distinction. In a short time\n",
      "the presence of Castruccio obtained such respect for the emperor that,\n",
      "without bloodshed or violence, good order was restored, chiefly by\n",
      "reason of Castruccio having sent by sea from the country round Pisa\n",
      "large quantities of corn, and thus removed the source of the trouble.\n",
      "When he had chastised some of the Roman leaders, and admonished others,\n",
      "voluntary obedience was rendered to Enrico. Castruccio received many\n",
      "honours, and was made a Roman senator. This dignity was assumed with the\n",
      "greatest pomp, Castruccio being clothed in a brocaded toga, which had\n",
      "the following words embroidered on its front: \"I am what God wills.\"\n",
      "Whilst on the back was: \"What God desires shall be.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "During this time the Florentines, who were much enraged that Castruccio\n",
      "should have seized Pistoia during the truce, considered how they could\n",
      "tempt the city to rebel, to do which they thought would not be difficult\n",
      "in his absence. Among the exiled Pistoians in Florence were Baldo Cecchi\n",
      "and Jacopo Baldini, both men of leading and ready to face danger. These\n",
      "men kept up communications with their friends in Pistoia, and with the\n",
      "aid of the Florentines entered the city by night, and after driving out\n",
      "some of Castruccio's officials and partisans, and killing others, they\n",
      "restored the city to its freedom. The news of this greatly angered\n",
      "Castruccio, and taking leave of Enrico, he pressed on in great haste to\n",
      "Pistoia. When the Florentines heard of his return, knowing that he would\n",
      "lose no time, they decided to intercept him with their forces in the\n",
      "Val di Nievole, under the belief that by doing so they would cut off his\n",
      "road to Pistoia. Assembling a great army of the supporters of the Guelph\n",
      "cause, the Florentines entered the Pistoian territories. On the other\n",
      "hand, Castruccio reached Montecarlo with his army; and having heard\n",
      "where the Florentines' lay, he decided not to encounter it in the plains\n",
      "of Pistoia, nor to await it in the plains of Pescia, but, as far as\n",
      "he possibly could, to attack it boldly in the Pass of Serravalle. He\n",
      "believed that if he succeeded in this design, victory was assured,\n",
      "although he was informed that the Florentines had thirty thousand men,\n",
      "whilst he had only twelve thousand. Although he had every confidence\n",
      "in his own abilities and the valour of his troops, yet he hesitated to\n",
      "attack his enemy in the open lest he should be overwhelmed by numbers.\n",
      "Serravalle is a castle between Pescia and Pistoia, situated on a hill\n",
      "which blocks the Val di Nievole, not in the exact pass, but about a\n",
      "bowshot beyond; the pass itself is in places narrow and steep, whilst in\n",
      "general it ascends gently, but is still narrow, especially at the summit\n",
      "where the waters divide, so that twenty men side by side could hold it.\n",
      "The lord of Serravalle was Manfred, a German, who, before Castruccio\n",
      "became lord of Pistoia, had been allowed to remain in possession of the\n",
      "castle, it being common to the Lucchese and the Pistoians, and unclaimed\n",
      "by either--neither of them wishing to displace Manfred as long as he\n",
      "kept his promise of neutrality, and came under obligations to no one.\n",
      "For these reasons, and also because the castle was well fortified,\n",
      "he had always been able to maintain his position. It was here that\n",
      "Castruccio had determined to fall upon his enemy, for here his few men\n",
      "would have the advantage, and there was no fear lest, seeing the large\n",
      "masses of the hostile force before they became engaged, they should not\n",
      "stand. As soon as this trouble with Florence arose, Castruccio saw the\n",
      "immense advantage which possession of this castle would give him, and\n",
      "having an intimate friendship with a resident in the castle, he managed\n",
      "matters so with him that four hundred of his men were to be admitted\n",
      "into the castle the night before the attack on the Florentines, and the\n",
      "castellan put to death.\n",
      "\n",
      "Castruccio, having prepared everything, had now to encourage the\n",
      "Florentines to persist in their desire to carry the seat of war away\n",
      "from Pistoia into the Val di Nievole, therefore he did not move his\n",
      "army from Montecarlo. Thus the Florentines hurried on until they reached\n",
      "their encampment under Serravalle, intending to cross the hill on the\n",
      "following morning. In the meantime, Castruccio had seized the castle at\n",
      "night, had also moved his army from Montecarlo, and marching from thence\n",
      "at midnight in dead silence, had reached the foot of Serravalle: thus he\n",
      "and the Florentines commenced the ascent of the hill at the same time in\n",
      "the morning. Castruccio sent forward his infantry by the main road,\n",
      "and a troop of four hundred horsemen by a path on the left towards the\n",
      "castle. The Florentines sent forward four hundred cavalry ahead of\n",
      "their army which was following, never expecting to find Castruccio in\n",
      "possession of the hill, nor were they aware of his having seized the\n",
      "castle. Thus it happened that the Florentine horsemen mounting the hill\n",
      "were completely taken by surprise when they discovered the infantry of\n",
      "Castruccio, and so close were they upon it they had scarcely time to\n",
      "pull down their visors. It was a case of unready soldiers being attacked\n",
      "by ready, and they were assailed with such vigour that with difficulty\n",
      "they could hold their own, although some few of them got through. When\n",
      "the noise of the fighting reached the Florentine camp below, it was\n",
      "filled with confusion. The cavalry and infantry became inextricably\n",
      "mixed: the captains were unable to get their men either backward or\n",
      "forward, owing to the narrowness of the pass, and amid all this tumult\n",
      "no one knew what ought to be done or what could be done. In a short time\n",
      "the cavalry who were engaged with the enemy's infantry were scattered\n",
      "or killed without having made any effective defence because of their\n",
      "unfortunate position, although in sheer desperation they had offered\n",
      "a stout resistance. Retreat had been impossible, with the mountains on\n",
      "both flanks, whilst in front were their enemies, and in the rear their\n",
      "friends. When Castruccio saw that his men were unable to strike a\n",
      "decisive blow at the enemy and put them to flight, he sent one thousand\n",
      "infantrymen round by the castle, with orders to join the four hundred\n",
      "horsemen he had previously dispatched there, and commanded the whole\n",
      "force to fall upon the flank of the enemy. These orders they carried out\n",
      "with such fury that the Florentines could not sustain the attack,\n",
      "but gave way, and were soon in full retreat--conquered more by their\n",
      "unfortunate position than by the valour of their enemy. Those in the\n",
      "rear turned towards Pistoia, and spread through the plains, each\n",
      "man seeking only his own safety. The defeat was complete and very\n",
      "sanguinary. Many captains were taken prisoners, among whom were\n",
      "Bandini dei Rossi, Francesco Brunelleschi, and Giovanni della Tosa, all\n",
      "Florentine noblemen, with many Tuscans and Neapolitans who fought on the\n",
      "Florentine side, having been sent by King Ruberto to assist the Guelphs.\n",
      "Immediately the Pistoians heard of this defeat they drove out the\n",
      "friends of the Guelphs, and surrendered to Castruccio. He was not\n",
      "content with occupying Prato and all the castles on the plains on both\n",
      "sides of the Arno, but marched his army into the plain of Peretola,\n",
      "about two miles from Florence. Here he remained many days, dividing the\n",
      "spoils, and celebrating his victory with feasts and games, holding\n",
      "horse races, and foot races for men and women. He also struck medals\n",
      "in commemoration of the defeat of the Florentines. He endeavoured to\n",
      "corrupt some of the citizens of Florence, who were to open the city\n",
      "gates at night; but the conspiracy was discovered, and the participators\n",
      "in it taken and beheaded, among whom were Tommaso Lupacci and\n",
      "Lambertuccio Frescobaldi. This defeat caused the Florentines great\n",
      "anxiety, and despairing of preserving their liberty, they sent envoys to\n",
      "King Ruberto of Naples, offering him the dominion of their city; and he,\n",
      "knowing of what immense importance the maintenance of the Guelph cause\n",
      "was to him, accepted it. He agreed with the Florentines to receive from\n",
      "them a yearly tribute of two hundred thousand florins, and he sent his\n",
      "son Carlo to Florence with four thousand horsemen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shortly after this the Florentines were relieved in some degree of the\n",
      "pressure of Castruccio's army, owing to his being compelled to leave\n",
      "his positions before Florence and march on Pisa, in order to suppress a\n",
      "conspiracy that had been raised against him by Benedetto Lanfranchi,\n",
      "one of the first men in Pisa, who could not endure that his fatherland\n",
      "should be under the dominion of the Lucchese. He had formed this\n",
      "conspiracy, intending to seize the citadel, kill the partisans of\n",
      "Castruccio, and drive out the garrison. As, however, in a conspiracy\n",
      "paucity of numbers is essential to secrecy, so for its execution a few\n",
      "are not sufficient, and in seeking more adherents to his conspiracy\n",
      "Lanfranchi encountered a person who revealed the design to Castruccio.\n",
      "This betrayal cannot be passed by without severe reproach to Bonifacio\n",
      "Cerchi and Giovanni Guidi, two Florentine exiles who were suffering\n",
      "their banishment in Pisa. Thereupon Castruccio seized Benedetto and put\n",
      "him to death, and beheaded many other noble citizens, and drove their\n",
      "families into exile. It now appeared to Castruccio that both Pisa and\n",
      "Pistoia were thoroughly disaffected; he employed much thought and energy\n",
      "upon securing his position there, and this gave the Florentines their\n",
      "opportunity to reorganize their army, and to await the coming of Carlo,\n",
      "the son of the King of Naples. When Carlo arrived they decided to lose\n",
      "no more time, and assembled a great army of more than thirty thousand\n",
      "infantry and ten thousand cavalry--having called to their aid every\n",
      "Guelph there was in Italy. They consulted whether they should attack\n",
      "Pistoia or Pisa first, and decided that it would be better to march on\n",
      "the latter--a course, owing to the recent conspiracy, more likely to\n",
      "succeed, and of more advantage to them, because they believed that the\n",
      "surrender of Pistoia would follow the acquisition of Pisa.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the early part of May 1328, the Florentines put in motion this army\n",
      "and quickly occupied Lastra, Signa, Montelupo, and Empoli, passing from\n",
      "thence on to San Miniato. When Castruccio heard of the enormous army\n",
      "which the Florentines were sending against him, he was in no degree\n",
      "alarmed, believing that the time had now arrived when Fortune would\n",
      "deliver the empire of Tuscany into his hands, for he had no reason to\n",
      "think that his enemy would make a better fight, or had better prospects\n",
      "of success, than at Pisa or Serravalle. He assembled twenty thousand\n",
      "foot soldiers and four thousand horsemen, and with this army went to\n",
      "Fucecchio, whilst he sent Pagolo Guinigi to Pisa with five thousand\n",
      "infantry. Fucecchio has a stronger position than any other town in\n",
      "the Pisan district, owing to its situation between the rivers Arno and\n",
      "Gusciana and its slight elevation above the surrounding plain. Moreover,\n",
      "the enemy could not hinder its being victualled unless they divided\n",
      "their forces, nor could they approach it either from the direction\n",
      "of Lucca or Pisa, nor could they get through to Pisa, or attack\n",
      "Castruccio's forces except at a disadvantage. In one case they would\n",
      "find themselves placed between his two armies, the one under his own\n",
      "command and the other under Pagolo, and in the other case they would\n",
      "have to cross the Arno to get to close quarters with the enemy, an\n",
      "undertaking of great hazard. In order to tempt the Florentines to take\n",
      "this latter course, Castruccio withdrew his men from the banks of the\n",
      "river and placed them under the walls of Fucecchio, leaving a wide\n",
      "expanse of land between them and the river.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Florentines, having occupied San Miniato, held a council of war to\n",
      "decide whether they should attack Pisa or the army of Castruccio, and,\n",
      "having weighed the difficulties of both courses, they decided upon the\n",
      "latter. The river Arno was at that time low enough to be fordable, yet\n",
      "the water reached to the shoulders of the infantrymen and to the\n",
      "saddles of the horsemen. On the morning of 10 June 1328, the Florentines\n",
      "commenced the battle by ordering forward a number of cavalry and ten\n",
      "thousand infantry. Castruccio, whose plan of action was fixed, and\n",
      "who well knew what to do, at once attacked the Florentines with five\n",
      "thousand infantry and three thousand horsemen, not allowing them to\n",
      "issue from the river before he charged them; he also sent one thousand\n",
      "light infantry up the river bank, and the same number down the Arno. The\n",
      "infantry of the Florentines were so much impeded by their arms and the\n",
      "water that they were not able to mount the banks of the river, whilst\n",
      "the cavalry had made the passage of the river more difficult for the\n",
      "others, by reason of the few who had crossed having broken up the bed of\n",
      "the river, and this being deep with mud, many of the horses rolled over\n",
      "with their riders and many of them had stuck so fast that they could not\n",
      "move. When the Florentine captains saw the difficulties their men were\n",
      "meeting, they withdrew them and moved higher up the river, hoping to\n",
      "find the river bed less treacherous and the banks more adapted for\n",
      "landing. These men were met at the bank by the forces which Castruccio\n",
      "had already sent forward, who, being light armed with bucklers and\n",
      "javelins in their hands, let fly with tremendous shouts into the faces\n",
      "and bodies of the cavalry. The horses, alarmed by the noise and the\n",
      "wounds, would not move forward, and trampled each other in great\n",
      "confusion. The fight between the men of Castruccio and those of the\n",
      "enemy who succeeded in crossing was sharp and terrible; both sides\n",
      "fought with the utmost desperation and neither would yield. The soldiers\n",
      "of Castruccio fought to drive the others back into the river, whilst the\n",
      "Florentines strove to get a footing on land in order to make room for\n",
      "the others pressing forward, who if they could but get out of the water\n",
      "would be able to fight, and in this obstinate conflict they were urged\n",
      "on by their captains. Castruccio shouted to his men that these were the\n",
      "same enemies whom they had before conquered at Serravalle, whilst the\n",
      "Florentines reproached each other that the many should be overcome by\n",
      "the few. At length Castruccio, seeing how long the battle had lasted,\n",
      "and that both his men and the enemy were utterly exhausted, and that\n",
      "both sides had many killed and wounded, pushed forward another body of\n",
      "infantry to take up a position at the rear of those who were fighting;\n",
      "he then commanded these latter to open their ranks as if they intended\n",
      "to retreat, and one part of them to turn to the right and another to\n",
      "the left. This cleared a space of which the Florentines at once took\n",
      "advantage, and thus gained possession of a portion of the battlefield.\n",
      "But when these tired soldiers found themselves at close quarters with\n",
      "Castruccio's reserves they could not stand against them and at once fell\n",
      "back into the river. The cavalry of either side had not as yet gained\n",
      "any decisive advantage over the other, because Castruccio, knowing his\n",
      "inferiority in this arm, had commanded his leaders only to stand on the\n",
      "defensive against the attacks of their adversaries, as he hoped that\n",
      "when he had overcome the infantry he would be able to make short work\n",
      "of the cavalry. This fell out as he had hoped, for when he saw the\n",
      "Florentine army driven back across the river he ordered the remainder\n",
      "of his infantry to attack the cavalry of the enemy. This they did with\n",
      "lance and javelin, and, joined by their own cavalry, fell upon the\n",
      "enemy with the greatest fury and soon put him to flight. The Florentine\n",
      "captains, having seen the difficulty their cavalry had met with in\n",
      "crossing the river, had attempted to make their infantry cross lower\n",
      "down the river, in order to attack the flanks of Castruccio's army.\n",
      "But here, also, the banks were steep and already lined by the men of\n",
      "Castruccio, and this movement was quite useless. Thus the Florentines\n",
      "were so completely defeated at all points that scarcely a third of them\n",
      "escaped, and Castruccio was again covered with glory. Many captains were\n",
      "taken prisoners, and Carlo, the son of King Ruberto, with Michelagnolo\n",
      "Falconi and Taddeo degli Albizzi, the Florentine commissioners, fled to\n",
      "Empoli. If the spoils were great, the slaughter was infinitely greater,\n",
      "as might be expected in such a battle. Of the Florentines there fell\n",
      "twenty thousand two hundred and thirty-one men, whilst Castruccio lost\n",
      "one thousand five hundred and seventy men.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Fortune growing envious of the glory of Castruccio took away his\n",
      "life just at the time when she should have preserved it, and thus ruined\n",
      "all those plans which for so long a time he had worked to carry into\n",
      "effect, and in the successful prosecution of which nothing but death\n",
      "could have stopped him. Castruccio was in the thick of the battle the\n",
      "whole of the day; and when the end of it came, although fatigued and\n",
      "overheated, he stood at the gate of Fucecchio to welcome his men on\n",
      "their return from victory and personally thank them. He was also on the\n",
      "watch for any attempt of the enemy to retrieve the fortunes of the day;\n",
      "he being of the opinion that it was the duty of a good general to be the\n",
      "first man in the saddle and the last out of it. Here Castruccio stood\n",
      "exposed to a wind which often rises at midday on the banks of the Arno,\n",
      "and which is often very unhealthy; from this he took a chill, of which\n",
      "he thought nothing, as he was accustomed to such troubles; but it was\n",
      "the cause of his death. On the following night he was attacked with high\n",
      "fever, which increased so rapidly that the doctors saw it must prove\n",
      "fatal. Castruccio, therefore, called Pagolo Guinigi to him, and\n",
      "addressed him as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I could have believed that Fortune would have cut me off in the\n",
      "midst of the career which was leading to that glory which all my\n",
      "successes promised, I should have laboured less, and I should have\n",
      "left thee, if a smaller state, at least with fewer enemies and perils,\n",
      "because I should have been content with the governorships of Lucca and\n",
      "Pisa. I should neither have subjugated the Pistoians, nor outraged the\n",
      "Florentines with so many injuries. But I would have made both these\n",
      "peoples my friends, and I should have lived, if no longer, at least more\n",
      "peacefully, and have left you a state without a doubt smaller, but one\n",
      "more secure and established on a surer foundation. But Fortune, who\n",
      "insists upon having the arbitrament of human affairs, did not endow me\n",
      "with sufficient judgment to recognize this from the first, nor the time\n",
      "to surmount it. Thou hast heard, for many have told thee, and I have\n",
      "never concealed it, how I entered the house of thy father whilst yet a\n",
      "boy--a stranger to all those ambitions which every generous soul should\n",
      "feel--and how I was brought up by him, and loved as though I had been\n",
      "born of his blood; how under his governance I learned to be valiant and\n",
      "capable of availing myself of all that fortune, of which thou hast been\n",
      "witness. When thy good father came to die, he committed thee and all his\n",
      "possessions to my care, and I have brought thee up with that love, and\n",
      "increased thy estate with that care, which I was bound to show. And in\n",
      "order that thou shouldst not only possess the estate which thy father\n",
      "left, but also that which my fortune and abilities have gained, I have\n",
      "never married, so that the love of children should never deflect my mind\n",
      "from that gratitude which I owed to the children of thy father. Thus I\n",
      "leave thee a vast estate, of which I am well content, but I am deeply\n",
      "concerned, inasmuch as I leave it thee unsettled and insecure. Thou hast\n",
      "the city of Lucca on thy hands, which will never rest contented under\n",
      "thy government. Thou hast also Pisa, where the men are of nature\n",
      "changeable and unreliable, who, although they may be sometimes held\n",
      "in subjection, yet they will ever disdain to serve under a Lucchese.\n",
      "Pistoia is also disloyal to thee, she being eaten up with factions and\n",
      "deeply incensed against thy family by reason of the wrongs recently\n",
      "inflicted upon them. Thou hast for neighbours the offended Florentines,\n",
      "injured by us in a thousand ways, but not utterly destroyed, who\n",
      "will hail the news of my death with more delight than they would the\n",
      "acquisition of all Tuscany. In the Emperor and in the princes of Milan\n",
      "thou canst place no reliance, for they are far distant, slow, and their\n",
      "help is very long in coming. Therefore, thou hast no hope in anything\n",
      "but in thine own abilities, and in the memory of my valour, and in the\n",
      "prestige which this latest victory has brought thee; which, as thou\n",
      "knowest how to use it with prudence, will assist thee to come to terms\n",
      "with the Florentines, who, as they are suffering under this great\n",
      "defeat, should be inclined to listen to thee. And whereas I have sought\n",
      "to make them my enemies, because I believed that war with them would\n",
      "conduce to my power and glory, thou hast every inducement to make\n",
      "friends of them, because their alliance will bring thee advantages\n",
      "and security. It is of the greatest important in this world that a man\n",
      "should know himself, and the measure of his own strength and means; and\n",
      "he who knows that he has not a genius for fighting must learn how to\n",
      "govern by the arts of peace. And it will be well for thee to rule\n",
      "thy conduct by my counsel, and to learn in this way to enjoy what my\n",
      "life-work and dangers have gained; and in this thou wilt easily succeed\n",
      "when thou hast learnt to believe that what I have told thee is true. And\n",
      "thou wilt be doubly indebted to me, in that I have left thee this realm\n",
      "and have taught thee how to keep it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After this there came to Castruccio those citizens of Pisa, Pistoia, and\n",
      "Lucca, who had been fighting at his side, and whilst recommending Pagolo\n",
      "to them, and making them swear obedience to him as his successor, he\n",
      "died. He left a happy memory to those who had known him, and no\n",
      "prince of those times was ever loved with such devotion as he was. His\n",
      "obsequies were celebrated with every sign of mourning, and he was buried\n",
      "in San Francesco at Lucca. Fortune was not so friendly to Pagolo Guinigi\n",
      "as she had been to Castruccio, for he had not the abilities. Not long\n",
      "after the death of Castruccio, Pagolo lost Pisa, and then Pistoia, and\n",
      "only with difficulty held on to Lucca. This latter city continued in the\n",
      "family of Guinigi until the time of the great-grandson of Pagolo.\n",
      "\n",
      "From what has been related here it will be seen that Castruccio was a\n",
      "man of exceptional abilities, not only measured by men of his own\n",
      "time, but also by those of an earlier date. In stature he was above\n",
      "the ordinary height, and perfectly proportioned. He was of a gracious\n",
      "presence, and he welcomed men with such urbanity that those who spoke\n",
      "with him rarely left him displeased. His hair was inclined to be red,\n",
      "and he wore it cut short above the ears, and, whether it rained or\n",
      "snowed, he always went without a hat. He was delightful among friends,\n",
      "but terrible to his enemies; just to his subjects; ready to play false\n",
      "with the unfaithful, and willing to overcome by fraud those whom he\n",
      "desired to subdue, because he was wont to say that it was the victory\n",
      "that brought the glory, not the methods of achieving it. No one was\n",
      "bolder in facing danger, none more prudent in extricating himself. He\n",
      "was accustomed to say that men ought to attempt everything and fear\n",
      "nothing; that God is a lover of strong men, because one always sees that\n",
      "the weak are chastised by the strong. He was also wonderfully sharp or\n",
      "biting though courteous in his answers; and as he did not look for any\n",
      "indulgence in this way of speaking from others, so he was not angered\n",
      "with others did not show it to him. It has often happened that he has\n",
      "listened quietly when others have spoken sharply to him, as on the\n",
      "following occasions. He had caused a ducat to be given for a partridge,\n",
      "and was taken to task for doing so by a friend, to whom Castruccio had\n",
      "said: \"You would not have given more than a penny.\" \"That is true,\"\n",
      "answered the friend. Then said Castruccio to him: \"A ducat is much less\n",
      "to me.\" Having about him a flatterer on whom he had spat to show that\n",
      "he scorned him, the flatterer said to him: \"Fisherman are willing to let\n",
      "the waters of the sea saturate them in order that they may take a few\n",
      "little fishes, and I allow myself to be wetted by spittle that I may\n",
      "catch a whale\"; and this was not only heard by Castruccio with patience\n",
      "but rewarded. When told by a priest that it was wicked for him to live\n",
      "so sumptuously, Castruccio said: \"If that be a vice then you should\n",
      "not fare so splendidly at the feasts of our saints.\" Passing through a\n",
      "street he saw a young man as he came out of a house of ill fame blush at\n",
      "being seen by Castruccio, and said to him: \"Thou shouldst not be ashamed\n",
      "when thou comest out, but when thou goest into such places.\" A friend\n",
      "gave him a very curiously tied knot to undo and was told: \"Fool, do\n",
      "you think that I wish to untie a thing which gave so much trouble to\n",
      "fasten.\" Castruccio said to one who professed to be a philosopher: \"You\n",
      "are like the dogs who always run after those who will give them the best\n",
      "to eat,\" and was answered: \"We are rather like the doctors who go to the\n",
      "houses of those who have the greatest need of them.\" Going by water from\n",
      "Pisa to Leghorn, Castruccio was much disturbed by a dangerous storm that\n",
      "sprang up, and was reproached for cowardice by one of those with him,\n",
      "who said that he did not fear anything. Castruccio answered that he\n",
      "did not wonder at that, since every man valued his soul for what is was\n",
      "worth. Being asked by one what he ought to do to gain estimation, he\n",
      "said: \"When thou goest to a banquet take care that thou dost not seat\n",
      "one piece of wood upon another.\" To a person who was boasting that he\n",
      "had read many things, Castruccio said: \"He knows better than to boast\n",
      "of remembering many things.\" Someone bragged that he could drink much\n",
      "without becoming intoxicated. Castruccio replied: \"An ox does the\n",
      "same.\" Castruccio was acquainted with a girl with whom he had intimate\n",
      "relations, and being blamed by a friend who told him that it was\n",
      "undignified for him to be taken in by a woman, he said: \"She has not\n",
      "taken me in, I have taken her.\" Being also blamed for eating very dainty\n",
      "foods, he answered: \"Thou dost not spend as much as I do?\" and being\n",
      "told that it was true, he continued: \"Then thou art more avaricious\n",
      "than I am gluttonous.\" Being invited by Taddeo Bernardi, a very rich and\n",
      "splendid citizen of Luca, to supper, he went to the house and was shown\n",
      "by Taddeo into a chamber hung with silk and paved with fine stones\n",
      "representing flowers and foliage of the most beautiful colouring.\n",
      "Castruccio gathered some saliva in his mouth and spat it out upon\n",
      "Taddeo, and seeing him much disturbed by this, said to him: \"I knew not\n",
      "where to spit in order to offend thee less.\" Being asked how Caesar\n",
      "died he said: \"God willing I will die as he did.\" Being one night in the\n",
      "house of one of his gentlemen where many ladies were assembled, he was\n",
      "reproved by one of his friends for dancing and amusing himself with\n",
      "them more than was usual in one of his station, so he said: \"He who is\n",
      "considered wise by day will not be considered a fool at night.\" A person\n",
      "came to demand a favour of Castruccio, and thinking he was not listening\n",
      "to his plea threw himself on his knees to the ground, and being sharply\n",
      "reproved by Castruccio, said: \"Thou art the reason of my acting thus for\n",
      "thou hast thy ears in thy feet,\" whereupon he obtained double the favour\n",
      "he had asked. Castruccio used to say that the way to hell was an easy\n",
      "one, seeing that it was in a downward direction and you travelled\n",
      "blindfolded. Being asked a favour by one who used many superfluous\n",
      "words, he said to him: \"When you have another request to make, send\n",
      "someone else to make it.\" Having been wearied by a similar man with a\n",
      "long oration who wound up by saying: \"Perhaps I have fatigued you by\n",
      "speaking so long,\" Castruccio said: \"You have not, because I have not\n",
      "listened to a word you said.\" He used to say of one who had been a\n",
      "beautiful child and who afterwards became a fine man, that he was\n",
      "dangerous, because he first took the husbands from the wives and now he\n",
      "took the wives from their husbands. To an envious man who laughed, he\n",
      "said: \"Do you laugh because you are successful or because another is\n",
      "unfortunate?\" Whilst he was still in the charge of Messer Francesco\n",
      "Guinigi, one of his companions said to him: \"What shall I give you if\n",
      "you will let me give you a blow on the nose?\" Castruccio answered:\n",
      "\"A helmet.\" Having put to death a citizen of Lucca who had been\n",
      "instrumental in raising him to power, and being told that he had done\n",
      "wrong to kill one of his old friends, he answered that people deceived\n",
      "themselves; he had only killed a new enemy. Castruccio praised greatly\n",
      "those men who intended to take a wife and then did not do so, saying\n",
      "that they were like men who said they would go to sea, and then refused\n",
      "when the time came. He said that it always struck him with surprise that\n",
      "whilst men in buying an earthen or glass vase would sound it first to\n",
      "learn if it were good, yet in choosing a wife they were content with\n",
      "only looking at her. He was once asked in what manner he would wish to\n",
      "be buried when he died, and answered: \"With the face turned downwards,\n",
      "for I know when I am gone this country will be turned upside down.\" On\n",
      "being asked if it had ever occurred to him to become a friar in order to\n",
      "save his soul, he answered that it had not, because it appeared strange\n",
      "to him that Fra Lazerone should go to Paradise and Uguccione della\n",
      "Faggiuola to the Inferno. He was once asked when should a man eat to\n",
      "preserve his health, and replied: \"If the man be rich let him eat\n",
      "when he is hungry; if he be poor, then when he can.\" Seeing one of his\n",
      "gentlemen make a member of his family lace him up, he said to him: \"I\n",
      "pray God that you will let him feed you also.\" Seeing that someone had\n",
      "written upon his house in Latin the words: \"May God preserve this house\n",
      "from the wicked,\" he said, \"The owner must never go in.\" Passing through\n",
      "one of the streets he saw a small house with a very large door, and\n",
      "remarked: \"That house will fly through the door.\" He was having a\n",
      "discussion with the ambassador of the King of Naples concerning the\n",
      "property of some banished nobles, when a dispute arose between them, and\n",
      "the ambassador asked him if he had no fear of the king. \"Is this king of\n",
      "yours a bad man or a good one?\" asked Castruccio, and was told that he\n",
      "was a good one, whereupon he said, \"Why should you suggest that I should\n",
      "be afraid of a good man?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I could recount many other stories of his sayings both witty and\n",
      "weighty, but I think that the above will be sufficient testimony to\n",
      "his high qualities. He lived forty-four years, and was in every way a\n",
      "prince. And as he was surrounded by many evidences of his good fortune,\n",
      "so he also desired to have near him some memorials of his bad fortune;\n",
      "therefore the manacles with which he was chained in prison are to be\n",
      "seen to this day fixed up in the tower of his residence, where they were\n",
      "placed by him to testify forever to his days of adversity. As in\n",
      "his life he was inferior neither to Philip of Macedon, the father of\n",
      "Alexander, nor to Scipio of Rome, so he died in the same year of his\n",
      "age as they did, and he would doubtless have excelled both of them had\n",
      "Fortune decreed that he should be born, not in Lucca, but in Macedonia\n",
      "or Rome.\n",
