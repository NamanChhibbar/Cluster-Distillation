       "  'Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov',\n",
       "  'Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov was the third son of Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov, a land owner well known in our district in his own day, and still remembered among us owing to his gloomy and tragic death, which happened thirteen years ago, and which I shall describe in its proper place.',\n",
       "  'For the present I will only say that this \"landowner\"--for so we used to call him, although he hardly spent a day of his life on his own estate--was a strange type, yet one pretty frequently to be met with, a type abject and vicious and at the same time senseless.',\n",
       "  'But he was one of those senseless persons who are very well capable of looking after their worldly affairs, and, apparently, after nothing else.',\n",
       "  \"Fyodor Pavlovitch, for instance, began with next to nothing; his estate was of the smallest; he ran to dine at other men's tables, and fastened on them as a toady, yet at his death it appeared that he had a hundred thousand roubles in hard cash.\",\n",
       "  'At the same time, he was all his life one of the most senseless, fantastical fellows in the whole district.',\n",
       "  'I repeat, it was not stupidity--the majority of these fantastical fellows are shrewd and intelligent enough--but just senselessness, and a peculiar national form of it.',\n",
       "  'He was married twice, and had three sons, the eldest, Dmitri, by his first wife, and two, Ivan and Alexey, by his second.',\n",
       "  \"Fyodor Pavlovitch's first wife, Adelaida Ivanovna, belonged to a fairly rich and distinguished noble family, also landowners in our district, the Miuesovs.\",\n",
       "  \"How it came to pass that an heiress, who was also a beauty, and moreover one of those vigorous, intelligent girls, so common in this generation, but sometimes also to be found in the last, could have married such a worthless, puny weakling, as we all called him, I won't attempt to explain.\",\n",
       "  'I knew a young lady of the last \"romantic\" generation who after some years of an enigmatic passion for a gentleman, whom she might quite easily have married at any moment, invented insuperable obstacles to their union, and ended by throwing herself one stormy night into a rather deep and rapid river from a high bank, almost a precipice, and so perished, entirely to satisfy her own caprice, and to be like Shakespeare\\'s Ophelia.',\n",
       "  'Indeed, if this precipice, a chosen and favorite spot of hers, had been less picturesque, if there had been a prosaic flat bank in its place, most likely the suicide would never have taken place.',\n",
       "  'This is a fact, and probably there have been not a few similar instances in the last two or three generations.',\n",
       "  \"Adelaida Ivanovna Miuesov's action was similarly, no doubt, an echo of other people's ideas, and was due to the irritation caused by lack of mental freedom.\",\n",
       "  'She wanted, perhaps, to show her feminine independence, to override class distinctions and the despotism of her family.',\n",
       "  'And a pliable imagination persuaded her, we must suppose, for a brief moment, that Fyodor Pavlovitch, in spite of his parasitic position, was one of the bold and ironical spirits of that progressive epoch, though he was, in fact, an ill-natured buffoon and nothing more.',\n",
       "  \"What gave the marriage piquancy was that it was preceded by an elopement, and this greatly captivated Adelaida Ivanovna's fancy.\",\n",
       "  \"Fyodor Pavlovitch's position at the time made him specially eager for any such enterprise, for he was passionately anxious to make a career in one way or another.\",\n",
       "  'To attach himself to a good family and obtain a dowry was an alluring prospect.',\n",
       "  \"As for mutual love it did not exist apparently, either in the bride or in him, in spite of Adelaida Ivanovna's beauty.\",\n",
       "  'This was, perhaps, a unique case of the kind in the life of Fyodor Pavlovitch, who was always of a voluptuous temper, and ready to run after any petticoat on the slightest encouragement.',\n",
       "  'She seems to have been the only woman who made no particular appeal to his senses.',\n",
       "  'Immediately after the elopement Adelaida Ivanovna discerned in a flash that she had no feeling for her husband but contempt.',\n",
       "  'The marriage accordingly showed itself in its true colors with extraordinary rapidity.',\n",
       "  'Although the family accepted the event pretty quickly and apportioned the runaway bride her dowry, the husband and wife began to lead a most disorderly life, and there were everlasting scenes between them.',\n",
       "  'It was said that the young wife showed incomparably more generosity and dignity than Fyodor Pavlovitch, who, as is now known, got hold of all her money up to twenty-five thousand roubles as soon as she received it, so that those thousands were lost to her for ever.',\n",
       "  'The little village and the rather fine town house which formed part of her dowry he did his utmost for a long time to transfer to his name, by means of some deed of conveyance.',\n",
       "  'He would probably have succeeded, merely from her moral fatigue and desire to get rid of him, and from the contempt and loathing he aroused by his persistent and shameless importunity.',\n",
       "  \"But, fortunately, Adelaida Ivanovna's family intervened and circumvented his greediness.\",\n",
       "  'It is known for a fact that frequent fights took place between the husband and wife, but rumor had it that Fyodor Pavlovitch did not beat his wife but was beaten by her, for she was a hot-tempered, bold, dark-browed, impatient woman, possessed of remarkable physical strength.',\n",
       "  \"Finally, she left the house and ran away from Fyodor Pavlovitch with a destitute divinity student, leaving Mitya, a child of three years old, in her husband's hands.\",\n",
       "  'Immediately Fyodor Pavlovitch introduced a regular harem into the house, and abandoned himself to orgies of drunkenness.',\n",
       "  \"In the intervals he used to drive all over the province, complaining tearfully to each and all of Adelaida Ivanovna's having left him, going into details too disgraceful for a husband to mention in regard to his own married life.\",\n",
       "  'What seemed to gratify him and flatter his self-love most was to play the ridiculous part of the injured husband, and to parade his woes with embellishments.',\n",
       "  '\"One would think that you\\'d got a promotion, Fyodor Pavlovitch, you seem so pleased in spite of your sorrow,\" scoffers said to him.',\n",
       "  'Many even added that he was glad of a new comic part in which to play the buffoon, and that it was simply to make it funnier that he pretended to be unaware of his ludicrous position.',\n",
       "  'But, who knows, it may have been simplicity.',\n",
       "  'At last he succeeded in getting on the track of his runaway wife.',\n",
       "  'The poor woman turned out to be in Petersburg, where she had gone with her divinity student, and where she had thrown herself into a life of complete emancipation.',\n",
       "  'Fyodor Pavlovitch at once began bustling about, making preparations to go to Petersburg, with what object he could not himself have said.',\n",
       "  'He would perhaps have really gone; but having determined to do so he felt at once entitled to fortify himself for the journey by another bout of reckless drinking.',\n",
       "  \"And just at that time his wife's family received the news of her death in Petersburg.\",\n",
       "  'She had died quite suddenly in a garret, according to one story, of typhus, or as another version had it, of starvation.',\n",
       "  \"Fyodor Pavlovitch was drunk when he heard of his wife's death, and the story is that he ran out into the street and began shouting with joy, raising his hands to Heaven:\",\n",
       "  '\"Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace,\" but others say he wept without restraint like a little child, so much so that people were sorry for him, in spite of the repulsion he inspired.',\n",
       "  'It is quite possible that both versions were true, that he rejoiced at his release, and at the same time wept for her who released him.',\n",
       "  'As a general rule, people, even the wicked, are much more naive and simple-hearted than we suppose.',\n",
       "  'And we ourselves are, too.',\n",
       "  'Chapter II. He Gets Rid Of His Eldest Son',\n",
       "  'You can easily imagine what a father such a man could be and how he would bring up his children.',\n",
       "  'His behavior as a father was exactly what might be expected.',\n",
       "  'He completely abandoned the child of his marriage with Adelaida Ivanovna, not from malice, nor because of his matrimonial grievances, but simply because he forgot him.',\n",
       "  'While he was wearying every one with his tears and complaints, and turning his house into a sink of debauchery, a faithful servant of the family, Grigory, took the three-year-old Mitya into his care.',\n",
       "  \"If he hadn't looked after him there would have been no one even to change the baby's little shirt.\",\n",
       "  \"It happened moreover that the child's relations on his mother's side forgot him too at first.\",\n",
       "  \"His grandfather was no longer living, his widow, Mitya's grandmother, had moved to Moscow, and was seriously ill, while his daughters were married, so that Mitya remained for almost a whole year in old Grigory's charge and lived with him in the servant's cottage.\",\n",
       "  'But if his father had remembered him (he could not, indeed, have been altogether unaware of his existence) he would have sent him back to the cottage, as the child would only have been in the way of his debaucheries.',\n",
       "  \"But a cousin of Mitya's mother, Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miuesov, happened to return from Paris.\",\n",
       "  'He lived for many years afterwards abroad, but was at that time quite a young man, and distinguished among the Miuesovs as a man of enlightened ideas and of European culture, who had been in the capitals and abroad.',\n",
       "  'Towards the end of his life he became a Liberal of the type common in the forties and fifties.',\n",
       "  'In the course of his career he had come into contact with many of the most Liberal men of his epoch, both in Russia and abroad.',\n",
       "  'He had known Proudhon and Bakunin personally, and in his declining years was very fond of describing the three days of the Paris Revolution of February 1848, hinting that he himself had almost taken part in the fighting on the barricades.',\n",
       "  'This was one of the most grateful recollections of his youth.',\n",
       "  'He had an independent property of about a thousand souls, to reckon in the old style.',\n",
       "  \"His splendid estate lay on the outskirts of our little town and bordered on the lands of our famous monastery, with which Pyotr Alexandrovitch began an endless lawsuit, almost as soon as he came into the estate, concerning the rights of fishing in the river or wood-cutting in the forest, I don't know exactly which.\",\n",
       "  'He regarded it as his duty as a citizen and a man of culture to open an attack upon the \"clericals.\"',\n",
       "  'Hearing all about Adelaida Ivanovna, whom he, of course, remembered, and in whom he had at one time been interested, and learning of the existence of Mitya, he intervened, in spite of all his youthful indignation and contempt for Fyodor Pavlovitch.',\n",
       "  \"He made the latter's acquaintance for the first time, and told him directly that he wished to undertake the child's education.\",\n",
       "  'He used long afterwards to tell as a characteristic touch, that when he began to speak of Mitya, Fyodor Pavlovitch looked for some time as though he did not understand what child he was talking about, and even as though he was surprised to hear that he had a little son in the house.',\n",
       "  'The story may have been exaggerated, yet it must have been something like the truth.',\n",
       "  'Fyodor Pavlovitch was all his life fond of acting, of suddenly playing an unexpected part, sometimes without any motive for doing so, and even to his own direct disadvantage, as, for instance, in the present case.',\n",
       "  'This habit, however, is characteristic of a very great number of people, some of them very clever ones, not like Fyodor Pavlovitch.',\n",
       "  'Pyotr Alexandrovitch carried the business through vigorously, and was appointed, with Fyodor Pavlovitch, joint guardian of the child, who had a small property, a house and land, left him by his mother.',\n",
       "  \"Mitya did, in fact, pass into this cousin's keeping, but as the latter had no family of his own, and after securing the revenues of his estates was in haste to return at once to Paris, he left the boy in charge of one of his cousins, a lady living in Moscow.\",\n",
       "  'It came to pass that, settling permanently in Paris he, too, forgot the child, especially when the Revolution of February broke out, making an impression on his mind that he remembered all the rest of his life.',\n",
       "  'The Moscow lady died, and Mitya passed into the care of one of her married daughters.',\n",
       "  'I believe he changed his home a fourth time later on.',\n",
       "  \"I won't enlarge upon that now, as I shall have much to tell later of Fyodor Pavlovitch's firstborn, and must confine myself now to the most essential facts about him, without which I could not begin my story.\",\n",
       "  \"In the first place, this Mitya, or rather Dmitri Fyodorovitch, was the only one of Fyodor Pavlovitch's three sons who grew up in the belief that he had property, and that he would be independent on coming of age.\",\n",
       "  'He spent an irregular boyhood and youth. He did not finish his studies at the gymnasium, he got into a military school, then went to the Caucasus, was promoted, fought a duel, and was degraded to the ranks, earned promotion again, led a wild life, and spent a good deal of money.',\n",
       "  'He did not begin to receive any income from Fyodor Pavlovitch until he came of age, and until then got into debt.',\n",
       "  'He saw and knew his father, Fyodor Pavlovitch, for the first time on coming of age, when he visited our neighborhood on purpose to settle with him about his property.',\n",
       "  'He seems not to have liked his father.',\n",
       "  'He did not stay long with him, and made haste to get away, having only succeeded in obtaining a sum of money, and entering into an agreement for future payments from the estate, of the revenues and value of which he was unable (a fact worthy of note), upon this occasion, to get a statement from his father.',\n",
       "  'Fyodor Pavlovitch remarked for the first time then (this, too, should be noted) that Mitya had a vague and exaggerated idea of his property.',\n",
       "  'Fyodor Pavlovitch was very well satisfied with this, as it fell in with his own designs.',\n",
       "  'He gathered only that the young man was frivolous, unruly, of violent passions, impatient, and dissipated, and that if he could only obtain ready money he would be satisfied, although only, of course, for a short time.',\n",
       "  'So Fyodor Pavlovitch began to take advantage of this fact, sending him from time to time small doles, installments.',\n",
       "  'In the end, when four years later, Mitya, losing patience, came a second time to our little town to settle up once for all with his father, it turned out to his amazement that he had nothing, that it was difficult to get an account even, that he had received the whole value of his property in sums of money from Fyodor Pavlovitch, and was perhaps even in debt to him, that by various agreements into which he had, of his own desire, entered at various previous dates, he had no right to expect anything more, and so on, and so on.',\n",
       "  'The young man was overwhelmed, suspected deceit and cheating, and was almost beside himself.',\n",
       "  'And, indeed, this circumstance led to the catastrophe, the account of which forms the subject of my first introductory story, or rather the external side of it.',\n",
       "  \"But before I pass to that story I must say a little of Fyodor Pavlovitch's other two sons, and of their origin.\",\n",
       "  'Chapter III. The Second Marriage And The Second Family',\n",
       "  'Very shortly after getting his four-year-old Mitya off his hands Fyodor Pavlovitch married a second time.',\n",
       "  'His second marriage lasted eight years.',\n",
       "  'He took this second wife, Sofya Ivanovna, also a very young girl, from another province, where he had gone upon some small piece of business in company with a Jew.',\n",
       "  'Though Fyodor Pavlovitch was a drunkard and a vicious debauchee he never neglected investing his capital, and managed his business affairs very successfully, though, no doubt, not over-',\n",
       "  'scrupulously.',\n",
       "  'Sofya Ivanovna was the daughter of an obscure deacon, and was left from childhood an orphan without relations.',\n",
       "  \"She grew up in the house of a general's widow, a wealthy old lady of good position, who was at once her benefactress and tormentor.\",\n",
       "  'I do not know the details, but I have only heard that the orphan girl, a meek and gentle creature, was once cut down from a halter in which she was hanging from a nail in the loft, so terrible were her sufferings from the caprice and everlasting nagging of this old woman, who was apparently not bad-hearted but had become an insufferable tyrant through idleness.',\n",
       "  'Fyodor Pavlovitch made her an offer; inquiries were made about him and he was refused.',\n",
       "  'But again, as in his first marriage, he proposed an elopement to the orphan girl.',\n",
       "  'There is very little doubt that she would not on any account have married him if she had known a little more about him in time.',\n",
       "  'But she lived in another province; besides, what could a little girl of sixteen know about it, except that she would be better at the bottom of the river than remaining with her benefactress.',\n",
       "  'So the poor child exchanged a benefactress for a benefactor.',\n",
       "  \"Fyodor Pavlovitch did not get a penny this time, for the general's widow was furious.\",\n",

       "  'The girl hesitated again, smiling.',\n",
       "  '\"She\\'s really very benevolent,\" she answered; after which she went over to her uncle, whose mirth was excited by her words.',\n",
       "  'Lord Warburton was left standing with Ralph Touchett, to whom in a moment he said:',\n",
       "  '\"You wished a while ago to see my idea of an interesting woman. There it is!\"',\n",
       "  \"Mrs. Touchett was certainly a person of many oddities, of which her behaviour on returning to her husband's house after many months was a noticeable specimen.\",\n",
       "  'She had her own way of doing all that she did, and this is the simplest description of a character which, although by no means without liberal motions, rarely succeeded in giving an impression of suavity.',\n",
       "  'Mrs. Touchett might do a great deal of good, but she never pleased.',\n",
       "  'This way of her own, of which she was so fond, was not intrinsically offensive--it was just unmistakeably distinguished from the ways of others.',\n",
       "  'The edges of her conduct were so very clear-cut that for susceptible persons it sometimes had a knife-like effect.',\n",
       "  'That hard fineness came out in her deportment during the first hours of her return from America, under circumstances in which it might have seemed that her first act would have been to exchange greetings with her husband and son.',\n",
       "  'Mrs. Touchett, for reasons which she deemed excellent, always retired on such occasions into impenetrable seclusion, postponing the more sentimental ceremony until she had repaired the disorder of dress with a completeness which had the less reason to be of high importance as neither beauty nor vanity were concerned in it.',\n",
       "  'She was a plain-faced old woman, without graces and without any great elegance, but with an extreme respect for her own motives.',\n",
       "  'She was usually prepared to explain these--when the explanation was asked as a favour; and in such a case they proved totally different from those that had been attributed to her.',\n",
       "  'She was virtually separated from her husband, but she appeared to perceive nothing irregular in the situation.',\n",
       "  'It had become clear, at an early stage of their community, that they should never desire the same thing at the same moment, and this appearance had prompted her to rescue disagreement from the vulgar realm of accident.',\n",
       "  'She did what she could to erect it into a law--a much more edifying aspect of it--by going to live in Florence, where she bought a house and established herself; and by leaving her husband to take care of the English branch of his bank.',\n",
       "  'This arrangement greatly pleased her; it was so felicitously definite.',\n",
       "  'It struck her husband in the same light, in a foggy square in London, where it was at times the most definite fact he discerned; but he would have preferred that such unnatural things should have a greater vagueness.',\n",
       "  'To agree to disagree had cost him an effort; he was ready to agree to almost anything but that, and saw no reason why either assent or dissent should be so terribly consistent.',\n",
       "  'Mrs. Touchett indulged in no regrets nor speculations, and usually came once a year to spend a month with her husband, a period during which she apparently took pains to convince him that she had adopted the right system.',\n",
       "  'She was not fond of the English style of life, and had three or four reasons for it to which she currently alluded; they bore upon minor points of that ancient order, but for Mrs. Touchett they amply justified non-residence.',\n",
       "  'She detested bread-sauce, which, as she said, looked like a poultice and tasted like soap; she objected to the consumption of beer by her maid-servants; and she affirmed that the British laundress (Mrs. Touchett was very particular about the appearance of her linen) was not a mistress of her art.',\n",
       "  'At fixed intervals she paid a visit to her own country; but this last had been longer than any of its predecessors.',\n",
       "  'She had taken up her niece--there was little doubt of that.',\n",
       "  'One wet afternoon, some four months earlier than the occurrence lately narrated, this young lady had been seated alone with a book.',\n",
       "  'To say she was so occupied is to say that her solitude did not press upon her; for her love of knowledge had a fertilising quality and her imagination was strong.',\n",
       "  'There was at this time, however, a want of fresh taste in her situation which the arrival of an unexpected visitor did much to correct.',\n",
       "  'The visitor had not been announced; the girl heard her at last walking about the adjoining room.',\n",
       "  'It was in an old house at Albany, a large, square, double house, with a notice of sale in the windows of one of the lower apartments.',\n",
       "  'There were two entrances, one of which had long been out of use but had never been removed.',\n",
       "  'They were exactly alike--large white doors, with an arched frame and wide side-lights, perched upon little \"stoops\" of red stone, which descended sidewise to the brick pavement of the street.',\n",
       "  'The two houses together formed a single dwelling, the party-wall having been removed and the rooms placed in communication.',\n",
       "  'These rooms, above-stairs, were extremely numerous, and were painted all over exactly alike, in a yellowish white which had grown sallow with time.',\n",
       "  'On the third floor there was a sort of arched passage, connecting the two sides of the house, which Isabel and her sisters used in their childhood to call the tunnel and which, though it was short and well lighted, always seemed to the girl to be strange and lonely, especially on winter afternoons.',\n",
       "  'She had been in the house, at different periods, as a child; in those days her grandmother lived there.',\n",
       "  \"Then there had been an absence of ten years, followed by a return to Albany before her father's death.\",\n",
       "  'Her grandmother, old Mrs. Archer, had exercised, chiefly within the limits of the family, a large hospitality in the early period, and the little girls often spent weeks under her roof--weeks of which Isabel had the happiest memory.',\n",
       "  \"The manner of life was different from that of her own home--larger, more plentiful, practically more festal; the discipline of the nursery was delightfully vague and the opportunity of listening to the conversation of one's elders (which with Isabel was a highly-valued pleasure) almost unbounded.\",\n",
       "  \"There was a constant coming and going; her grandmother's sons and daughters and their children appeared to be in the enjoyment of standing invitations to arrive and remain, so that the house offered to a certain extent the appearance of a bustling provincial inn kept by a gentle old landlady who sighed a great deal and never presented a bill.\",\n",
       "  \"Isabel of course knew nothing about bills; but even as a child she thought her grandmother's home romantic.\",\n",
       "  'There was a covered piazza behind it, furnished with a swing which was a source of tremulous interest; and beyond this was a long garden, sloping down to the stable and containing peach-trees of barely credible familiarity.',\n",
       "  'Isabel had stayed with her grandmother at various seasons, but somehow all her visits had a flavour of peaches.',\n",
       "  'On the other side, across the street, was an old house that was called the Dutch House--a peculiar structure dating from the earliest colonial time, composed of bricks that had been painted yellow, crowned with a gable that was pointed out to strangers, defended by a rickety wooden paling and standing sidewise to the street.',\n",
       "  \"It was occupied by a primary school for children of both sexes, kept or rather let go, by a demonstrative lady of whom Isabel's chief recollection was that her hair was fastened with strange bedroomy combs at the temples and that she was the widow of some one of consequence.\",\n",
       "  'The little girl had been offered the opportunity of laying a foundation of knowledge in this establishment; but having spent a single day in it, she had protested against its laws and had been allowed to stay at home, where, in the September days, when the windows of the Dutch House were open, she used to hear the hum of childish voices repeating the multiplication table--an incident in which the elation of liberty and the pain of exclusion were indistinguishably mingled.',\n",
       "  \"The foundation of her knowledge was really laid in the idleness of her grandmother's house, where, as most of the other inmates were not reading people, she had uncontrolled use of a library full of books with frontispieces, which she used to climb upon a chair to take down.\",\n",
       "  'When she had found one to her taste--she was guided in the selection chiefly by the frontispiece--she carried it into a mysterious apartment which lay beyond the library and which was called, traditionally, no one knew why, the office.',\n",
       "  'Whose office it had been and at what period it had flourished, she never learned; it was enough for her that it contained an echo and a pleasant musty smell and that it was a chamber of disgrace for old pieces of furniture whose infirmities were not always apparent (so that the disgrace seemed unmerited and rendered them victims of injustice) and with which, in the manner of children, she had established relations almost human, certainly dramatic.',\n",
       "  'There was an old haircloth sofa in especial, to which she had confided a hundred childish sorrows.',\n",
       "  'The place owed much of its mysterious melancholy to the fact that it was properly entered from the second door of the house, the door that had been condemned, and that it was secured by bolts which a particularly slender little girl found it impossible to slide.',\n",
       "  'She knew that this silent, motionless portal opened into the street; if the sidelights had not been filled with green paper she might have looked out upon the little brown stoop and the well-worn brick pavement.',\n",
       "  \"But she had no wish to look out, for this would have interfered with her theory that there was a strange, unseen place on the other side--a place which became to the child's imagination, according to its different moods, a region of delight or of terror.\",\n",
       "  'It was in the \"office\" still that Isabel was sitting on that melancholy afternoon of early spring which I have just mentioned.',\n",
       "  'At this time she might have had the whole house to choose from, and the room she had selected was the most depressed of its scenes.',\n",
       "  'She had never opened the bolted door nor removed the green paper (renewed by other hands) from its sidelights; she had never assured herself that the vulgar street lay beyond.',\n",
       "  'A crude, cold rain fell heavily; the spring-time was indeed an appeal--and it seemed a cynical, insincere appeal--to patience.',\n",
       "  'Isabel, however, gave as little heed as possible to cosmic treacheries; she kept her eyes on her book and tried to fix her mind.',\n",
       "  'It had lately occurred to her that her mind was a good deal of a vagabond, and she had spent much ingenuity in training it to a military step and teaching it to advance, to halt, to retreat, to perform even more complicated manoeuvres, at the word of command.',\n",
       "  'Just now she had given it marching orders and it had been trudging over the sandy plains of a history of German Thought.',\n",
       "  'Suddenly she became aware of a step very different from her own intellectual pace; she listened a little and perceived that some one was moving in the library, which communicated with the office.',\n",
       "  'It struck her first as the step of a person from whom she was looking for a visit, then almost immediately announced itself as the tread of a woman and a stranger--her possible visitor being neither.',\n",
       "  'It had an inquisitive, experimental quality which suggested that it would not stop short of the threshold of the office; and in fact the doorway of this apartment was presently occupied by a lady who paused there and looked very hard at our heroine.',\n",
       "  'She was a plain, elderly woman, dressed in a comprehensive waterproof mantle; she had a face with a good deal of rather violent point.',\n",
       "  '\"Oh,\" she began, \"is that where you usually sit?\"',\n",
       "  'She looked about at the heterogeneous chairs and tables.',\n",
       "  '\"Not when I have visitors,\" said Isabel, getting up to receive the intruder.',\n",
       "  'She directed their course back to the library while the visitor continued to look about her.',\n",
       "  '\"You seem to have plenty of other rooms; they\\'re in rather better condition. But everything\\'s immensely worn.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Have you come to look at the house?\" Isabel asked.',\n",
       "  '\"The servant will show it to you.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Send her away; I don\\'t want to buy it. She has probably gone to look for you and is wandering about upstairs; she didn\\'t seem at all intelligent. You had better tell her it\\'s no matter.\"',\n",
       "  'And then, since the girl stood there hesitating and wondering, this unexpected critic said to her abruptly:',\n",
       "  '\"I suppose you\\'re one of the daughters?\"',\n",
       "  'Isabel thought she had very strange manners.',\n",
       "  '\"It depends upon whose daughters you mean.\"',\n",
       "  '\"The late Mr. Archer\\'s--and my poor sister\\'s.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Ah,\" said Isabel slowly, \"you must be our crazy Aunt Lydia!\"',\n",
       "  '\"Is that what your father told you to call me? I\\'m your Aunt Lydia, but I\\'m not at all crazy: I haven\\'t a delusion! And which of the daughters are you?\"',\n",
       "  '\"I\\'m the youngest of the three, and my name\\'s Isabel.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Yes; the others are Lilian and Edith. And are you the prettiest?\"',\n",
       "  '\"I haven\\'t the least idea,\" said the girl.',\n",
       "  '\"I think you must be.\"',\n",
       "  'And in this way the aunt and the niece made friends.',\n",
       "  'The aunt had quarrelled years before with her brother-in-law, after the death of her sister, taking him to task for the manner in which he brought up his three girls.',\n",
       "  'Being a high-tempered man he had requested her to mind her own business, and she had taken him at his word.',\n",
       "  'For many years she held no communication with him and after his death had addressed not a word to his daughters, who had been bred in that disrespectful view of her which we have just seen Isabel betray.',\n",
       "  \"Mrs. Touchett's behaviour was, as usual, perfectly deliberate. She intended to go to America to look after her investments (with which her husband, in spite of his great financial position, had nothing to do) and would take advantage of this opportunity to enquire into the condition of her nieces.\",\n",
       "  \"There was no need of writing, for she should attach no importance to any account of them she should elicit by letter; she believed, always, in seeing for one's self.\",\n",
       "  \"Isabel found, however, that she knew a good deal about them, and knew about the marriage of the two elder girls; knew that their poor father had left very little money, but that the house in Albany, which had passed into his hands, was to be sold for their benefit; knew, finally, that Edmund Ludlow, Lilian's husband, had taken upon himself to attend to this matter, in consideration of which the young couple, who had come to Albany during Mr. Archer's illness, were remaining there for the present and, as well as Isabel herself, occupying the old place.\",\n",
       "  '\"How much money do you expect for it?\" Mrs. Touchett asked of her companion, who had brought her to sit in the front parlour, which she had inspected without enthusiasm.',\n",
       "  '\"I haven\\'t the least idea,\" said the girl.',\n",
       "  '\"That\\'s the second time you have said that to me,\" her aunt rejoined.',\n",
       "  '\"And yet you don\\'t look at all stupid.\"',\n",
       "  '\"I\\'m not stupid; but I don\\'t know anything about money.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Yes, that\\'s the way you were brought up--as if you were to inherit a million. What have you in point of fact inherited?\"',\n",
       "  '\"I really can\\'t tell you. You must ask Edmund and Lilian; they\\'ll be back in half an hour.\"',\n",
       "  '\"In Florence we should call it a very bad house,\" said Mrs. Touchett; \"but here, I dare say, it will bring a high price. It ought to make a considerable sum for each of you. In addition to that you must have something else; it\\'s most extraordinary your not knowing. The position\\'s of value, and they\\'ll probably pull it down and make a row of shops. I wonder you don\\'t do that yourself; you might let the shops to great advantage.\"',\n",
       "  'Isabel stared; the idea of letting shops was new to her.',\n",
       "  '\"I hope they won\\'t pull it down,\" she said; \"I\\'m extremely fond of it.\"',\n",
       "  '\"I don\\'t see what makes you fond of it; your father died here.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Yes; but I don\\'t dislike it for that,\" the girl rather strangely returned.',\n",
       "  '\"I like places in which things have happened--even if they\\'re sad things. A great many people have died here; the place has been full of life.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Is that what you call being full of life?\"',\n",
       "  '\"I mean full of experience--of people\\'s feelings and sorrows. And not of their sorrows only, for I\\'ve been very happy here as a child.\"',\n",
       "  '\"You should go to Florence if you like houses in which things have happened--especially deaths. I live in an old palace in which three people have been murdered; three that were known and I don\\'t know how many more besides.\"',\n",
       "  '\"In an old palace?\" Isabel repeated.',\n",
       "  '\"Yes, my dear; a very different affair from this. This is very bourgeois.\"',\n",
       "  \"Isabel felt some emotion, for she had always thought highly of her grandmother's house.\",\n",
       "  'But the emotion was of a kind which led her to say:',\n",
       "  '\"I should like very much to go to Florence.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Well, if you\\'ll be very good, and do everything I tell you I\\'ll take you there,\" Mrs. Touchett declared.',\n",
       "  \"Our young woman's emotion deepened; she flushed a little and smiled at her aunt in silence.\",\n",
       "  '\"Do everything you tell me? I don\\'t think I can promise that.\"',\n",
       "  '\"No, you don\\'t look like a person of that sort. You\\'re fond of your own way; but it\\'s not for me to blame you.\"',\n",
       "  '\"And yet, to go to Florence,\" the girl exclaimed in a moment, \"I\\'d promise almost anything!\"',\n",
       "  \"Edmund and Lilian were slow to return, and Mrs. Touchett had an hour's uninterrupted talk with her niece, who found her a strange and interesting figure: a figure essentially--almost the first she had ever met.\",\n",
       "  'She was as eccentric as Isabel had always supposed; and hitherto, whenever the girl had heard people described as eccentric, she had thought of them as offensive or alarming.',\n",
       "  'The term had always suggested to her something grotesque and even sinister.',\n",
       "  'But her aunt made it a matter of high but easy irony, or comedy, and led her to ask herself if the common tone, which was all she had known, had ever been as interesting.',\n",
       "  'No one certainly had on any occasion so held her as this little thin-lipped, bright-eyed, foreign-looking woman, who retrieved an insignificant appearance by a distinguished manner and, sitting there in a well-worn waterproof, talked with striking familiarity of the courts of Europe.',\n",
       "  'There was nothing flighty about Mrs. Touchett, but she recognised no social superiors, and, judging the great ones of the earth in a way that spoke of this, enjoyed the consciousness of making an impression on a candid and susceptible mind.',\n",
       "  'Isabel at first had answered a good many questions, and it was from her answers apparently that Mrs. Touchett derived a high opinion of her intelligence.',\n",
       "  \"But after this she had asked a good many, and her aunt's answers, whatever turn they took, struck her as food for deep reflexion.\",\n",
       "  \"Mrs. Touchett waited for the return of her other niece as long as she thought reasonable, but as at six o'clock Mrs. Ludlow had not come in she prepared to take her departure.\",\n",
       "  '\"Your sister must be a great gossip. Is she accustomed to staying out so many hours?\"',\n",
       "  '\"You\\'ve been out almost as long as she,\" Isabel replied; \"she can have left the house but a short time before you came in.\"',\n",
       "  'Mrs. Touchett looked at the girl without resentment; she appeared to enjoy a bold retort and to be disposed to be gracious.',\n",
       "  '\"Perhaps she hasn\\'t had so good an excuse as I. Tell her at any rate that she must come and see me this evening at that horrid hotel. She may bring her husband if she likes, but she needn\\'t bring you. I shall see plenty of you later.\"',\n",
       "  'Mrs. Ludlow was the eldest of the three sisters, and was usually thought the most sensible; the classification being in general that Lilian was the practical one, Edith the beauty and Isabel the \"intellectual\" superior.',\n",
       "  'Mrs. Keyes, the second of the group, was the wife of an officer of the United States Engineers, and as our history is not further concerned with her it will suffice that she was indeed very pretty and that she formed the ornament of those various military stations, chiefly in the unfashionable West, to which, to her deep chagrin, her husband was successively relegated.',\n",
       "  \"Lilian had married a New York lawyer, a young man with a loud voice and an enthusiasm for his profession; the match was not brilliant, any more than Edith's, but Lilian had occasionally been spoken of as a young woman who might be thankful to marry at all--she was so much plainer than her sisters.\",\n",
       "  'She was, however, very happy, and now, as the mother of two peremptory little boys and the mistress of a wedge of brown stone violently driven into Fifty-third Street, seemed to exult in her condition as in a bold escape.',\n",
       "  \"She was short and solid, and her claim to figure was questioned, but she was conceded presence, though not majesty; she had moreover, as people said, improved since her marriage, and the two things in life of which she was most distinctly conscious were her husband's force in argument and her sister Isabel's originality.\",\n",
       "  '\"I\\'ve never kept up with Isabel--it would have taken all my time,\" she had often remarked; in spite of which, however, she held her rather wistfully in sight; watching her as a motherly spaniel might watch a free greyhound.',\n",

There\\'s a good deal in that, but I acted conscientiously; I thought she was meant for something better. It occurred to me that it would be a kindness to take her about and introduce her to the world.

       "  '\"No,\" said Ralph; \"you yourself are a proof of that. You\\'re extremely natural, and I\\'m sure you have never troubled any one. It takes trouble to do that. But tell me this; it just occurs to me. Is Isabel capable of making herself disagreeable?\"',\n",
       "  '\"Ah,\" cried his mother, \"you ask too many questions! Find that out for yourself.\"',\n",
       "  'His questions, however, were not exhausted.',\n",
       "  '\"All this time,\" he said, \"you\\'ve not told me what you intend to do with her.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Do with her? You talk as if she were a yard of calico. I shall do absolutely nothing with her, and she herself will do everything she chooses. She gave me notice of that.\"',\n",
       "  '\"What you meant then, in your telegram, was that her character\\'s independent.\"',\n",
       "  '\"I never know what I mean in my telegrams--especially those I send from America. Clearness is too expensive. Come down to your father.\"',\n",
       "  '\"It\\'s not yet a quarter to eight,\" said Ralph.',\n",
       "  '\"I must allow for his impatience,\" Mrs. Touchett answered.',\n",
       "  \"Ralph knew what to think of his father's impatience; but, making no rejoinder, he offered his mother his arm.\",\n",
       "  'This put it in his power, as they descended together, to stop her a moment on the middle landing of the staircase--the broad, low, wide-armed staircase of time-blackened oak which was one of the most striking features of Gardencourt.',\n",
       "  '\"You\\'ve no plan of marrying her?\" he smiled.',\n",
       "  '\"Marrying her? I should be sorry to play her such a trick! But apart from that, she\\'s perfectly able to marry herself. She has every facility.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Do you mean to say she has a husband picked out?\"',\n",
       "  '\"I don\\'t know about a husband, but there\\'s a young man in Boston--!\"',\n",
       "  'Ralph went on; he had no desire to hear about the young man in Boston.',\n",
       "  '\"As my father says, they\\'re always engaged!\"',\n",
       "  'His mother had told him that he must satisfy his curiosity at the source, and it soon became evident he should not want for occasion.',\n",
       "  'He had a good deal of talk with his young kinswoman when the two had been left together in the drawing-room.',\n",
       "  'Lord Warburton, who had ridden over from his own house, some ten miles distant, remounted and took his departure before dinner; and an hour after this meal was ended Mr. and Mrs. Touchett, who appeared to have quite emptied the measure of their forms, withdrew, under the valid pretext of fatigue, to their respective apartments.',\n",
       "  'The young man spent an hour with his cousin; though she had been travelling half the day she appeared in no degree spent.',\n",
       "  'She was really tired; she knew it, and knew she should pay for it on the morrow; but it was her habit at this period to carry exhaustion to the furthest point and confess to it only when dissimulation broke down.',\n",
       "  'A fine hypocrisy was for the present possible; she was interested; she was, as she said to herself, floated.',\n",
       "  'She asked Ralph to show her the pictures; there were a great many in the house, most of them of his own choosing.',\n",
       "  'The best were arranged in an oaken gallery, of charming proportions, which had a sitting-room at either end of it and which in the evening was usually lighted.',\n",
       "  'The light was insufficient to show the pictures to advantage, and the visit might have stood over to the morrow.',\n",
       "  'This suggestion Ralph had ventured to make; but Isabel looked disappointed--smiling still, however--and said:',\n",
       "  '\"If you please I should like to see them just a little.\"',\n",
       "  \"She was eager, she knew she was eager and now seemed so; she couldn't help it.\",\n",
       "  '\"She doesn\\'t take suggestions,\" Ralph said to himself; but he said it without irritation; her pressure amused and even pleased him.',\n",
       "  'The lamps were on brackets, at intervals, and if the light was imperfect it was genial.',\n",
       "  'It fell upon the vague squares of rich colour and on the faded gilding of heavy frames; it made a sheen on the polished floor of the gallery.',\n",
       "  'Ralph took a candlestick and moved about, pointing out the things he liked; Isabel, inclining to one picture after another, indulged in little exclamations and murmurs.',\n",
       "  'She was evidently a judge; she had a natural taste; he was struck with that.',\n",
       "  'She took a candlestick herself and held it slowly here and there; she lifted it high, and as she did so he found himself pausing in the middle of the place and bending his eyes much less upon the pictures than on her presence.',\n",
       "  'He lost nothing, in truth, by these wandering glances, for she was better worth looking at than most works of art.',\n",
       "  'She was undeniably spare, and ponderably light, and proveably tall; when people had wished to distinguish her from the other two Miss Archers they had always called her the willowy one.',\n",
       "  'Her hair, which was dark even to blackness, had been an object of envy to many women; her light grey eyes, a little too firm perhaps in her graver moments, had an enchanting range of concession.',\n",
       "  'They walked slowly up one side of the gallery and down the other, and then she said:',\n",
       "  '\"Well, now I know more than I did when I began!\"',\n",
       "  '\"You apparently have a great passion for knowledge,\" her cousin returned.',\n",

       "  '\"You strike me as different from most girls.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Ah, some of them would--but the way they\\'re talked to!\" murmured Isabel, who preferred not to dilate just yet on herself.',\n",
       "  'Then in a moment, to change the subject,',\n",
       "  '\"Please tell me--isn\\'t there a ghost?\" she went on.',\n",
       "  '\"A ghost?\"',\n",
       "  '\"A castle-spectre, a thing that appears. We call them ghosts in America.\"',\n",

       "  '\"It\\'s not a romantic old house,\" said Ralph.',\n",
       "  '\"You\\'ll be disappointed if you count on that. It\\'s a dismally prosaic one; there\\'s no romance here but what you may have brought with you.\"',\n",
       "  '\"I\\'ve brought a great deal; but it seems to me I\\'ve brought it to the right place.\"',\n",
       "  '\"To keep it out of harm, certainly; nothing will ever happen to it here, between my father and me.\"',\n",
       "  'Isabel looked at him a moment.',\n",
       "  '\"Is there never any one here but your father and you?\"',\n",
       "  '\"My mother, of course.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Oh, I know your mother; she\\'s not romantic. Haven\\'t you other people?\"',\n",
       "  '\"Very few.\"',\n",
       "  '\"I\\'m sorry for that; I like so much to see people.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Oh, we\\'ll invite all the county to amuse you,\" said Ralph.',\n",
       "  '\"Now you\\'re making fun of me,\" the girl answered rather gravely.',\n",
       "  '\"Who was the gentleman on the lawn when I arrived?\"',\n",
       "  '\"A county neighbour; he doesn\\'t come very often.\"',\n",
       "  '\"I\\'m sorry for that; I liked him,\" said Isabel.',\n",
       "  '\"Why, it seemed to me that you barely spoke to him,\"',\n",
       "  'Ralph objected.',\n",
       "  '\"Never mind, I like him all the same. I like your father too, immensely.\"',\n",
       "  '\"You can\\'t do better than that. He\\'s the dearest of the dear.\"',\n",
       "  '\"I\\'m so sorry he is ill,\" said Isabel.',\n",
       "  '\"You must help me to nurse him; you ought to be a good nurse.\"',\n",
       "  '\"I don\\'t think I am; I\\'ve been told I\\'m not; I\\'m said to have too many theories. But you haven\\'t told me about the ghost,\" she added.',\n",
       "  'Ralph, however, gave no heed to this observation.',\n",
       "  '\"You like my father and you like Lord Warburton. I infer also that you like my mother.\"',\n",
       "  '\"I like your mother very much, because--because--\"',\n",
       "  'And Isabel found herself attempting to assign a reason for her affection for Mrs. Touchett.',\n",
       "  '\"Ah, we never know why!\" said her companion, laughing.',\n",
       "  '\"I always know why,\" the girl answered.',\n",
       "  '\"It\\'s because she doesn\\'t expect one to like her. She doesn\\'t care whether one does or not.\"',\n",
       "  '\"So you adore her--out of perversity? Well, I take greatly after my mother,\" said Ralph.',\n",
       "  '\"I don\\'t believe you do at all. You wish people to like you, and you try to make them do it.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Good heavens, how you see through one!\" he cried with a dismay that was not altogether jocular.',\n",
       "  '\"But I like you all the same,\" his cousin went on.',\n",
       "  '\"The way to clinch the matter will be to show me the ghost.\"',\n",
       "  'Ralph shook his head sadly.',\n",
       "  '\"I might show it to you, but you\\'d never see it. The privilege isn\\'t given to every one; it\\'s not enviable. It has never been seen by a young, happy, innocent person like you. You must have suffered first, have suffered greatly, have gained some miserable knowledge. In that way your eyes are opened to it.',\n",
       "  'I saw it long ago,\" said Ralph.',\n",
       "  '\"I told you just now I\\'m very fond of knowledge,\" Isabel answered.',\n",
       "  '\"Yes, of happy knowledge--of pleasant knowledge. But you haven\\'t suffered, and you\\'re not made to suffer. I hope you\\'ll never see the ghost!\"',\n",
       "  'She had listened to him attentively, with a smile on her lips, but with a certain gravity in her eyes.',\n",
       "  'Charming as he found her, she had struck him as rather presumptuous--indeed it was a part of her charm; and he wondered what she would say.',\n",
       "  '\"I\\'m not afraid, you know,\" she said:',\n",
       "  'which seemed quite presumptuous enough.',\n",
       "  '\"You\\'re not afraid of suffering?\"',\n",
       "  '\"Yes, I\\'m afraid of suffering. But I\\'m not afraid of ghosts. And I think people suffer too easily,\" she added.',\n",
       "  '\"I don\\'t believe you do,\" said Ralph, looking at her with his hands in his pockets.',\n",
       "  '\"I don\\'t think that\\'s a fault,\" she answered.',\n",
       "  '\"It\\'s not absolutely necessary to suffer; we were not made for that.\"',\n",
       "  '\"You were not, certainly.\"',\n",
       "  '\"I\\'m not speaking of myself.\"',\n",
       "  'And she wandered off a little.',\n",
       "  '\"No, it isn\\'t a fault,\" said her cousin.',\n",
       "  '\"It\\'s a merit to be strong.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Only, if you don\\'t suffer they call you hard,\" Isabel remarked.',\n",
       "  'They passed out of the smaller drawing-room, into which they had returned from the gallery, and paused in the hall, at the foot of the staircase.',\n",
       "  'Here Ralph presented his companion with her bedroom candle, which he had taken from a niche.',\n",
       "  '\"Never mind what they call you. When you do suffer they call you an idiot. The great point\\'s to be as happy as possible.\"',\n",
       "  'She looked at him a little; she had taken her candle and placed her foot on the oaken stair.',\n",
       "  '\"Well,\" she said, \"that\\'s what I came to Europe for, to be as happy as possible. Good-night.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Good-night! I wish you all success, and shall be very glad to contribute to it!\"',\n",
       "  'She turned away, and he watched her as she slowly ascended.',\n",
       "  'Then, with his hands always in his pockets, he went back to the empty drawing-room.',\n",
       "  'Isabel Archer was a young person of many theories; her imagination was remarkably active.',\n",
       "  'It had been her fortune to possess a finer mind than most of the persons among whom her lot was cast; to have a larger perception of surrounding facts and to care for knowledge that was tinged with the unfamiliar.',\n",
       "  'It is true that among her contemporaries she passed for a young woman of extraordinary profundity; for these excellent people never withheld their admiration from a reach of intellect of which they themselves were not conscious, and spoke of Isabel as a prodigy of learning, a creature reported to have read the classic authors--in translations.',\n",
       "  'Her paternal aunt, Mrs. Varian, once spread the rumour that Isabel was writing a book--Mrs. Varian having a reverence for books, and averred that the girl would distinguish herself in print.',\n",
       "  'Mrs. Varian thought highly of literature, for which she entertained that esteem that is connected with a sense of privation.',\n",
       "  'Her own large house, remarkable for its assortment of mosaic tables and decorated ceilings, was unfurnished with a library, and in the way of printed volumes contained nothing but half a dozen novels in paper on a shelf in the apartment of one of the Miss Varians.',\n",
       "  \"Practically, Mrs. Varian's acquaintance with literature was confined to The New York Interviewer; as she very justly said, after you had read the Interviewer you had lost all faith in culture.\",\n",
       "  'Her tendency, with this, was rather to keep the Interviewer out of the way of her daughters; she was determined to bring them up properly, and they read nothing at all.',\n",
       "  \"Her impression with regard to Isabel's labours was quite illusory; the girl had never attempted to write a book and had no desire for the laurels of authorship. She had no talent for expression and too little of the consciousness of genius; she only had a general idea that people were right when they treated her as if she were rather superior.\",\n",
       "  'Whether or no she were superior, people were right in admiring her if they thought her so; for it seemed to her often that her mind moved more quickly than theirs, and this encouraged an impatience that might easily be confounded with superiority.',\n",
       "  'It may be affirmed without delay that Isabel was probably very liable to the sin of self-esteem; she often surveyed with complacency the field of her own nature; she was in the habit of taking for granted, on scanty evidence, that she was right; she treated herself to occasions of homage.',\n",
       "  'Meanwhile her errors and delusions were frequently such as a biographer interested in preserving the dignity of his subject must shrink from specifying.',\n",
       "  'Her thoughts were a tangle of vague outlines which had never been corrected by the judgement of people speaking with authority.',\n",
       "  'In matters of opinion she had had her own way, and it had led her into a thousand ridiculous zigzags.',\n",
       "  'At moments she discovered she was grotesquely wrong, and then she treated herself to a week of passionate humility.',\n",
       "  'After this she held her head higher than ever again; for it was of no use, she had an unquenchable desire to think well of herself.',\n",
       "  \"She had a theory that it was only under this provision life was worth living; that one should be one of the best, should be conscious of a fine organisation (she couldn't help knowing her organisation was fine), should move in a realm of light, of natural wisdom, of happy impulse, of inspiration gracefully chronic.\",\n",
       "  \"It was almost as unnecessary to cultivate doubt of one's self as to cultivate doubt of one's best friend: one should try to be one's own best friend and to give one's self, in this manner, distinguished company.\",\n",
       "  'The girl had a certain nobleness of imagination which rendered her a good many services and played her a great many tricks.',\n",
       "  'She spent half her time in thinking of beauty and bravery and magnanimity; she had a fixed determination to regard the world as a place of brightness, of free expansion, of irresistible action: she held it must be detestable to be afraid or ashamed.',\n",
       "  'She had an infinite hope that she should never do anything wrong.',\n",
       "  'She had resented so strongly, after discovering them, her mere errors of feeling (the discovery always made her tremble as if she had escaped from a trap which might have caught her and smothered her) that the chance of inflicting a sensible injury upon another person, presented only as a contingency, caused her at moments to hold her breath.',\n",
       "  'That always struck her as the worst thing that could happen to her.',\n",
       "  'On the whole, reflectively, she was in no uncertainty about the things that were wrong.',\n",
       "  'She had no love of their look, but when she fixed them hard she recognised them.',\n",
       "  'It was wrong to be mean, to be jealous, to be false, to be cruel; she had seen very little of the evil of the world, but she had seen women who lied and who tried to hurt each other.',\n",
       "  'Seeing such things had quickened her high spirit; it seemed indecent not to scorn them.',\n",
       "  'Of course the danger of a high spirit was the danger of inconsistency--the danger of keeping up the flag after the place has surrendered; a sort of behaviour so crooked as to be almost a dishonour to the flag.',\n",
       "  'But Isabel, who knew little of the sorts of artillery to which young women are exposed, flattered herself that such contradictions would never be noted in her own conduct.',\n",
       "  'Her life should always be in harmony with the most pleasing impression she should produce; she would be what she appeared, and she would appear what she was.',\n",
       "  'Sometimes she went so far as to wish that she might find herself some day in a difficult position, so that she should have the pleasure of being as heroic as the occasion demanded.',\n",
       "  \"Altogether, with her meagre knowledge, her inflated ideals, her confidence at once innocent and dogmatic, her temper at once exacting and indulgent, her mixture of curiosity and fastidiousness, of vivacity and indifference, her desire to look very well and to be if possible even better, her determination to see, to try, to know, her combination of the delicate, desultory, flame-like spirit and the eager and personal creature of conditions: she would be an easy victim of scientific criticism if she were not intended to awaken on the reader's part an impulse more tender and more purely expectant.\",\n",
       "  'It was one of her theories that Isabel Archer was very fortunate in being independent, and that she ought to make some very enlightened use of that state.',\n",
       "  'She never called it the state of solitude, much less of singleness; she thought such descriptions weak, and, besides, her sister Lily constantly urged her to come and abide.',\n",
       "  \"She had a friend whose acquaintance she had made shortly before her father's death, who offered so high an example of useful activity that Isabel always thought of her as a model.\",\n",

       "  'Isabel pronounced them with confidence \"ephemeral,\" but she esteemed the courage, energy and good-humour of the writer, who, without parents and without property, had adopted three of the children of an infirm and widowed sister and was paying their school-bills out of the proceeds of her literary labour.',\n",
       "  'Henrietta was in the van of progress and had clear-cut views on most subjects; her cherished desire had long been to come to Europe and write a series of letters to the Interviewer from the radical point of view--an enterprise the less difficult as she knew perfectly in advance what her opinions would be and to how many objections most European institutions lay open.',\n",
       "  'When she heard that Isabel was coming she wished to start at once; thinking, naturally, that it would be delightful the two should travel together.',\n",
       "  'She had been obliged, however, to postpone this enterprise.',\n",
       "  'She thought Isabel a glorious creature, and had spoken of her covertly in some of her letters, though she never mentioned the fact to her friend, who would not have taken pleasure in it and was not a regular student of the Interviewer.',\n",
       "  'Henrietta, for Isabel, was chiefly a proof that a woman might suffice to herself and be happy.',\n",
       "  \"Her resources were of the obvious kind; but even if one had not the journalistic talent and a genius for guessing, as Henrietta said, what the public was going to want, one was not therefore to conclude that one had no vocation, no beneficent aptitude of any sort, and resign one's self to being frivolous and hollow.\",\n",
       "  \"Isabel was stoutly determined not to be hollow. If one should wait with the right patience one would find some happy work to one's hand.\",\n",
       "  'Of course, among her theories, this young lady was not without a collection of views on the subject of marriage.',\n",
       "  'The first on the list was a conviction of the vulgarity of thinking too much of it.',\n",
       "  'From lapsing into eagerness on this point she earnestly prayed she might be delivered; she held that a woman ought to be able to live to herself, in the absence of exceptional flimsiness, and that it was perfectly possible to be happy without the society of a more or less coarse-minded person of another sex.',\n",
       "  \"The girl's prayer was very sufficiently answered; something pure and proud that there was in her--something cold and dry an unappreciated suitor with a taste for analysis might have called it--had hitherto kept her from any great vanity of conjecture on the article of possible husbands.\",\n",
       "  'Few of the men she saw seemed worth a ruinous expenditure, and it made her smile to think that one of them should present himself as an incentive to hope and a reward of patience.',\n",
       "  'Deep in her soul--it was the deepest thing there--lay a belief that if a certain light should dawn she could give herself completely; but this image, on the whole, was too formidable to be attractive.',\n",
       "  \"Isabel's thoughts hovered about it, but they seldom rested on it long; after a little it ended in alarms.\",\n",
       "  'It often seemed to her that she thought too much about herself; you could have made her colour, any day in the year, by calling her a rank egoist.',\n",
       "  'She was always planning out her development, desiring her perfection, observing her progress.',\n",
       "  \"Her nature had, in her conceit, a certain garden-like quality, a suggestion of perfume and murmuring boughs, of shady bowers and lengthening vistas, which made her feel that introspection was, after all, an exercise in the open air, and that a visit to the recesses of one's spirit was harmless when one returned from it with a lapful of roses.\",\n",
       "  'But she was often reminded that there were other gardens in the world than those of her remarkable soul, and that there were moreover a great many places which were not gardens at all--only dusky pestiferous tracts, planted thick with ugliness and misery.',\n",
       "  'In the current of that repaid curiosity on which she had lately been floating, which had conveyed her to this beautiful old England and might carry her much further still, she often checked herself with the thought of the thousands of people who were less happy than herself--a thought which for the moment made her fine, full consciousness appear a kind of immodesty.',\n",
       "  \"What should one do with the misery of the world in a scheme of the agreeable for one's self?\",\n",

       "  'She always returned to her theory that a young woman whom after all every one thought clever should begin by getting a general impression of life.',\n",
       "  'This impression was necessary to prevent mistakes, and after it should be secured she might make the unfortunate condition of others a subject of special attention.',\n",
       "  'England was a revelation to her, and she found herself as diverted as a child at a pantomime.',\n",
       "  \"In her infantine excursions to Europe she had seen only the Continent, and seen it from the nursery window; Paris, not London, was her father's Mecca, and into many of his interests there his children had naturally not entered.\",\n",

       "  'The large, low rooms, with brown ceilings and dusky corners, the deep embrasures and curious casements, the quiet light on dark, polished panels, the deep greenness outside, that seemed always peeping in, the sense of well-ordered privacy in the centre of a \"property\"--a place where sounds were felicitously accidental, where the tread was muffed by the earth itself and in the thick mild air all friction dropped out of contact and all shrillness out of talk--these things were much to the taste of our young lady, whose taste played a considerable part in her emotions.',\n",
       "  'She formed a fast friendship with her uncle, and often sat by his chair when he had had it moved out to the lawn.',\n",
       "  'He passed hours in the open air, sitting with folded hands like a placid, homely household god, a god of service, who had done his work and received his wages and was trying to grow used to weeks and months made up only of off-days.',\n",

I\\'m of an inquisitive disposition, though you mightn\\'t think it if you were to watch me: however much you might watch me I should be watching you more. I\\'ve been watching these people for upwards of thirty-five years, and I don\\'t hesitate to say that I\\'ve acquired considerable information.

Such slender faculty of reverence as he possessed centred wholly upon his father; for the rest, he exercised his wit indifferently upon his father's son, this gentleman's weak lungs, his useless life, his fantastic mother, his friends (Lord Warburton in especial), his adopted, and his native country, his charming new-found cousin.\",\n",

       "  'But of the two triumphs, that of refuting a sophistical son and that of holding on a while longer to a state of being which, with all abatements, he enjoyed, Ralph deemed it no sin to hope the latter might be vouchsafed to Mr. Touchett.',\n",

       "  'This follows also on another natural and common necessity, which always causes a new prince to burden those who have submitted to him with his soldiery and with infinite other hardships which he must put upon his new acquisition.In this way you have enemies in all those whom you have injured in seizing that principality, and you are not able to keep those friends who put you there because of your not being able to satisfy them in the way they expected, and you cannot take strong measures against them, feeling bound to them. For, although one may be very strong in armed forces, yet in entering a province one has always need of the goodwill of the natives.',\n",
       "  \"For these reasons Louis the Twelfth, King of France, quickly occupied Milan, and as quickly lost it; and to turn him out the first time it only needed Lodovico's own forces; because those who had opened the gates to him, finding themselves deceived in their hopes of future benefit, would not endure the ill-treatment of the new prince.\",\n",
       "  'It is very true that, after acquiring rebellious provinces a second time, they are not so lightly lost afterwards, because the prince, with little reluctance, takes the opportunity of the rebellion to punish the delinquents, to clear out the suspects, and to strengthen himself in the weakest places.',\n",
       "  'Thus to cause France to lose Milan the first time it was enough for the Duke Lodovico(*) to raise insurrections on the borders; but to cause him to lose it a second time it was necessary to bring the whole world against him, and that his armies should be defeated and driven out of Italy; which followed from the causes above mentioned.',\n",

       "  'Now I say that those dominions which, when acquired, are added to an ancient state by him who acquires them, are either of the same country and language, or they are not. When they are, it is easier to hold them, especially when they have not been accustomed to self-government; and to hold them securely it is enough to have destroyed the family of the prince who was ruling them; because the two peoples, preserving in other things the old conditions, and not being unlike in customs, will live quietly together, as one has seen in Brittany, Burgundy, Gascony, and Normandy, which have been bound to France for so long a time: and, although there may be some difference in language, nevertheless the customs are alike, and the people will easily be able to get on amongst themselves.',\n",
       "  'He who has annexed them, if he wishes to hold them, has only to bear in mind two considerations: the one, that the family of their former lord is extinguished; the other, that neither their laws nor their taxes are altered, so that in a very short time they will become entirely one body with the old principality.',\n",
       "  'But when states are acquired in a country differing in language, customs, or laws, there are difficulties, and good fortune and great energy are needed to hold them, and one of the greatest and most real helps would be that he who has acquired them should go and reside there. This would make his position more secure and durable, as it has made that of the Turk in Greece, who, notwithstanding all the other measures taken by him for holding that state, if he had not settled there, would not have been able to keep it.',\n",
       "  'Because, if one is on the spot, disorders are seen as they spring up, and one can quickly remedy them; but if one is not at hand, they are heard of only when they are great, and then one can no longer remedy them.',\n",
       "  'Besides this, the country is not pillaged by your officials; the subjects are satisfied by prompt recourse to the prince; thus, wishing to be good, they have more cause to love him, and wishing to be otherwise, to fear him.',\n",
       "  'He who would attack that state from the outside must have the utmost caution; as long as the prince resides there it can only be wrested from him with the greatest difficulty.',\n",
       "  'The other and better course is to send colonies to one or two places, which may be as keys to that state, for it is necessary either to do this or else to keep there a great number of cavalry and infantry.',\n",
       "  'A prince does not spend much on colonies, for with little or no expense he can send them out and keep them there, and he offends a minority only of the citizens from whom he takes lands and houses to give them to the new inhabitants; and those whom he offends, remaining poor and scattered, are never able to injure him; whilst the rest being uninjured are easily kept quiet, and at the same time are anxious not to err for fear it should happen to them as it has to those who have been despoiled.',\n",

       "  'For every reason, therefore, such guards are as useless as a colony is useful.',\n",
       "  'Again, the prince who holds a country differing in the above respects ought to make himself the head and defender of his less powerful neighbours, and to weaken the more powerful amongst them, taking care that no foreigner as powerful as himself shall, by any accident, get a footing there; for it will always happen that such a one will be introduced by those who are discontented, either through excess of ambition or through fear, as one has seen already.',\n",
       "  'The Romans were brought into Greece by the Aetolians; and in every other country where they obtained a footing they were brought in by the inhabitants.',\n",
       "  'And the usual course of affairs is that, as soon as a powerful foreigner enters a country, all the subject states are drawn to him, moved by the hatred which they feel against the ruling power.',\n",
       "  'So that in respect to those subject states he has not to take any trouble to gain them over to himself, for the whole of them quickly rally to the state which he has acquired there. He has only to take care that they do not get hold of too much power and too much authority, and then with his own forces, and with their goodwill, he can easily keep down the more powerful of them, so as to remain entirely master in the country.',\n",

       "  'The Romans, in the countries which they annexed, observed closely these measures; they sent colonies and maintained friendly relations with(*) the minor powers, without increasing their strength; they kept down the greater, and did not allow any strong foreign powers to gain authority.',\n",

       "  'The Achaeans and Aetolians were kept friendly by them, the kingdom of Macedonia was humbled, Antiochus was driven out; yet the merits of the Achaeans and Aetolians never secured for them permission to increase their power, nor did the persuasions of Philip ever induce the Romans to be his friends without first humbling him, nor did the influence of Antiochus make them agree that he should retain any lordship over the country.',\n",
       "  'Because the Romans did in these instances what all prudent princes ought to do, who have to regard not only present troubles, but also future ones, for which they must prepare with every energy, because, when foreseen, it is easy to remedy them; but if you wait until they approach, the medicine is no longer in time because the malady has become incurable; for it happens in this, as the physicians say it happens in hectic fever, that in the beginning of the malady it is easy to cure but difficult to detect, but in the course of time, not having been either detected or treated in the beginning, it becomes easy to detect but difficult to cure.',\n",

       "  'Therefore, the Romans, foreseeing troubles, dealt with them at once, and, even to avoid a war, would not let them come to a head, for they knew that war is not to be avoided, but is only to be put off to the advantage of others; moreover they wished to fight with Philip and Antiochus in Greece so as not to have to do it in Italy; they could have avoided both, but this they did not wish; nor did that ever please them which is forever in the mouths of the wise ones of our time:--Let us enjoy the benefits of the time--but rather the benefits of their own valour and prudence, for time drives everything before it, and is able to bring with it good as well as evil, and evil as well as good.',\n",

Those who so bind themselves, and are not rapacious, ought to be honoured and loved; those who do not bind themselves may be dealt with in two ways; they may fail to do this through pusillanimity and a natural want of courage, in which case you ought to make use of them, especially of those who are of good counsel; and thus, whilst in prosperity you honour them, in adversity you do not have to fear them. But when for their own ambitious ends they shun binding themselves, it is a token that they are giving more thought to themselves than to you, and a prince ought to guard against such, and to fear them as if they were open enemies, because in adversity they always help to ruin him.Therefore, one who becomes a prince through the favour of the people ought to keep them friendly, and this he can easily do seeing they only ask not to be oppressed by him.',\n",

For such a prince cannot rely upon what he observes in quiet times, when citizens have need of the state, because then every one agrees with him; they all promise, and when death is far distant they all wish to die for him; but in troubled times, when the state has need of its citizens, then he finds but few.',\n",

       "  'Now, concerning the characteristics of which mention is made above, I have spoken of the more important ones, the others I wish to discuss briefly under this generality, that the prince must consider, as has been in part said before, how to avoid those things which will make him hated or contemptible; and as often as he shall have succeeded he will have fulfilled his part, and he need not fear any danger in other reproaches.',\n",
       "  'It makes him hated above all things, as I have said, to be rapacious, and to be a violator of the property and women of his subjects, from both of which he must abstain.',\n",
       "  'And when neither their property nor their honor is touched, the majority of men live content, and he has only to contend with the ambition of a few, whom he can curb with ease in many ways.It makes him contemptible to be considered fickle, frivolous, effeminate, mean-spirited, irresolute, from all of which a prince should guard himself as from a rock; and he should endeavour to show in his actions greatness, courage, gravity, and fortitude; and in his private dealings with his subjects let him show that his judgments are irrevocable, and maintain himself in such reputation that no one can hope either to deceive him or to get round him.',\n",
       "  'That prince is highly esteemed who conveys this impression of himself, and he who is highly esteemed is not easily conspired against; for, provided it is well known that he is an excellent man and revered by his people, he can only be attacked with difficulty.',\n",
       "  'For this reason a prince ought to have two fears, one from within, on account of his subjects, the other from without, on account of external powers. From the latter he is defended by being well armed and having good allies, and if he is well armed he will have good friends, and affairs will always remain quiet within when they are quiet without, unless they should have been already disturbed by conspiracy; and even should affairs outside be disturbed, if he has carried out his preparations and has lived as I have said, as long as he does not despair, he will resist every attack, as I said Nabis the Spartan did.',\n",
       "  'But concerning his subjects, when affairs outside are disturbed he has only to fear that they will conspire secretly, from which a prince can easily secure himself by avoiding being hated and despised, and by keeping the people satisfied with him, which it is most necessary for him to accomplish, as I said above at length.',\n",
       "  'And one of the most efficacious remedies that a prince can have against conspiracies is not to be hated and despised by the people, for he who conspires against a prince always expects to please them by his removal; but when the conspirator can only look forward to offending them, he will not have the courage to take such a course, for the difficulties that confront a conspirator are infinite.',\n",
       "  'And as experience shows, many have been the conspiracies, but few have been successful; because he who conspires cannot act alone, nor can he take a companion except from those whom he believes to be malcontents, and as soon as you have opened your mind to a malcontent you have given him the material with which to content himself, for by denouncing you he can look for every advantage; so that, seeing the gain from this course to be assured, and seeing the other to be doubtful and full of dangers, he must be a very rare friend, or a thoroughly obstinate enemy of the prince, to keep faith with you.',\n",
       "  'And, to reduce the matter into a small compass, I say that, on the side of the conspirator, there is nothing but fear, jealousy, prospect of punishment to terrify him; but on the side of the prince there is the majesty of the principality, the laws, the protection of friends and the state to defend him; so that, adding to all these things the popular goodwill, it is impossible that any one should be so rash as to conspire.',\n",
       "  'For whereas in general the conspirator has to fear before the execution of his plot, in this case he has also to fear the sequel to the crime; because on account of it he has the people for an enemy, and thus cannot hope for any escape.',\n",
       "  'Endless examples could be given on this subject, but I will be content with one, brought to pass within the memory of our fathers.',\n",
       "  'Messer Annibale Bentivogli, who was prince in Bologna (grandfather of the present Annibale), having been murdered by the Canneschi, who had conspired against him, not one of his family survived but Messer Giovanni,(*) who was in childhood: immediately after his assassination the people rose and murdered all the Canneschi.',\n",
       "  'This sprung from the popular goodwill which the house of Bentivogli enjoyed in those days in Bologna; which was so great that, although none remained there after the death of Annibale who was able to rule the state, the Bolognese, having information that there was one of the Bentivogli family in Florence, who up to that time had been considered the son of a blacksmith, sent to Florence for him and gave him the government of their city, and it was ruled by him until Messer Giovanni came in due course to the government.',\n",

       "  'For this reason I consider that a prince ought to reckon conspiracies of little account when his people hold him in esteem; but when it is hostile to him, and bears hatred towards him, he ought to fear everything and everybody.',\n",
       "  'And well-ordered states and wise princes have taken every care not to drive the nobles to desperation, and to keep the people satisfied and contented, for this is one of the most important objects a prince can have.',\n",
       "  'Among the best ordered and governed kingdoms of our times is France, and in it are found many good institutions on which depend the liberty and security of the king; of these the first is the parliament and its authority, because he who founded the kingdom, knowing the ambition of the nobility and their boldness, considered that a bit to their mouths would be necessary to hold them in; and, on the other side, knowing the hatred of the people, founded in fear, against the nobles, he wished to protect them, yet he was not anxious for this to be the particular care of the king; therefore, to take away the reproach which he would be liable to from the nobles for favouring the people, and from the people for favouring the nobles, he set up an arbiter, who should be one who could beat down the great and favour the lesser without reproach to the king.',\n",
       "  'Neither could you have a better or a more prudent arrangement, or a greater source of security to the king and kingdom.',\n",
       "  'From this one can draw another important conclusion, that princes ought to leave affairs of reproach to the management of others, and keep those of grace in their own hands.',\n",
       "  'And further, I consider that a prince ought to cherish the nobles, but not so as to make himself hated by the people.',\n",
       "  'It may appear, perhaps, to some who have examined the lives and deaths of the Roman emperors that many of them would be an example contrary to my opinion, seeing that some of them lived nobly and showed great qualities of soul, nevertheless they have lost their empire or have been killed by subjects who have conspired against them.',\n",
       "  'Wishing, therefore, to answer these objections, I will recall the characters of some of the emperors, and will show that the causes of their ruin were not different to those alleged by me; at the same time I will only submit for consideration those things that are noteworthy to him who studies the affairs of those times.',\n",
       "  'It seems to me sufficient to take all those emperors who succeeded to the empire from Marcus the philosopher down to Maximinus; they were Marcus and his son Commodus, Pertinax, Julian, Severus and his son Antoninus Caracalla, Macrinus, Heliogabalus, Alexander, and Maximinus.',\n",
       "  'There is first to note that, whereas in other principalities the ambition of the nobles and the insolence of the people only have to be contended with, the Roman emperors had a third difficulty in having to put up with the cruelty and avarice of their soldiers, a matter so beset with difficulties that it was the ruin of many; for it was a hard thing to give satisfaction both to soldiers and people; because the people loved peace, and for this reason they loved the unaspiring prince, whilst the soldiers loved the warlike prince who was bold, cruel, and rapacious, which qualities they were quite willing he should exercise upon the people, so that they could get double pay and give vent to their own greed and cruelty.',\n",
       "  'Hence it arose that those emperors were always overthrown who, either by birth or training, had no great authority, and most of them, especially those who came new to the principality, recognizing the difficulty of these two opposing humours, were inclined to give satisfaction to the soldiers, caring little about injuring the people.',\n",
       "  'Which course was necessary, because, as princes cannot help being hated by someone, they ought, in the first place, to avoid being hated by every one, and when they cannot compass this, they ought to endeavour with the utmost diligence to avoid the hatred of the most powerful.',\n",
       "  'Therefore, those emperors who through inexperience had need of special favour adhered more readily to the soldiers than to the people; a course which turned out advantageous to them or not, accordingly as the prince knew how to maintain authority over them.',\n",
       "  'From these causes it arose that Marcus, Pertinax, and Alexander, being all men of modest life, lovers of justice, enemies to cruelty, humane, and benignant, came to a sad end except Marcus; he alone lived and died honoured, because he had succeeded to the throne by hereditary title, and owed nothing either to the soldiers or the people; and afterwards, being possessed of many virtues which made him respected, he always kept both orders in their places whilst he lived, and was neither hated nor despised.',\n",
       "  'But Pertinax was created emperor against the wishes of the soldiers, who, being accustomed to live licentiously under Commodus, could not endure the honest life to which Pertinax wished to reduce them; thus, having given cause for hatred, to which hatred there was added contempt for his old age, he was overthrown at the very beginning of his administration.',\n",
       "  'And here it should be noted that hatred is acquired as much by good works as by bad ones, therefore, as I said before, a prince wishing to keep his state is very often forced to do evil; for when that body is corrupt whom you think you have need of to maintain yourself--it may be either the people or the soldiers or the nobles--you have to submit to its humours and to gratify them, and then good works will do you harm.',\n",
       "  'But let us come to Alexander, who was a man of such great goodness, that among the other praises which are accorded him is this, that in the fourteen years he held the empire no one was ever put to death by him unjudged; nevertheless, being considered effeminate and a man who allowed himself to be governed by his mother, he became despised, the army conspired against him, and murdered him.',\n",
       "  'Turning now to the opposite characters of Commodus, Severus, Antoninus Caracalla, and Maximinus, you will find them all cruel and rapacious-men who, to satisfy their soldiers, did not hesitate to commit every kind of iniquity against the people; and all, except Severus, came to a bad end; but in Severus there was so much valour that, keeping the soldiers friendly, although the people were oppressed by him, he reigned successfully; for his valour made him so much admired in the sight of the soldiers and people that the latter were kept in a way astonished and awed and the former respectful and satisfied.',\n",
       "  'And because the actions of this man, as a new prince, were great, I wish to show briefly that he knew well how to counterfeit the fox and the lion, which natures, as I said above, it is necessary for a prince to imitate.',\n",
       "  'Knowing the sloth of the Emperor Julian, he persuaded the army in Sclavonia, of which he was captain, that it would be right to go to Rome and avenge the death of Pertinax, who had been killed by the praetorian soldiers; and under this pretext, without appearing to aspire to the throne, he moved the army on Rome, and reached Italy before it was known that he had started.',\n",
       "  'On his arrival at Rome, the Senate, through fear, elected him emperor and killed Julian.',\n",
       "  'After this there remained for Severus, who wished to make himself master of the whole empire, two difficulties; one in Asia, where Niger, head of the Asiatic army, had caused himself to be proclaimed emperor; the other in the west where Albinus was, who also aspired to the throne. And as he considered it dangerous to declare himself hostile to both, he decided to attack Niger and to deceive Albinus.',\n",
       "  'To the latter he wrote that, being elected emperor by the Senate, he was willing to share that dignity with him and sent him the title of Caesar; and, moreover, that the Senate had made Albinus his colleague; which things were accepted by Albinus as true.',\n",
       "  'But after Severus had conquered and killed Niger, and settled oriental affairs, he returned to Rome and complained to the Senate that Albinus, little recognizing the benefits that he had received from him, had by treachery sought to murder him, and for this ingratitude he was compelled to punish him.',\n",
       "  'Afterwards he sought him out in France, and took from him his government and life.',\n",
       "  'He who will, therefore, carefully examine the actions of this man will find him a most valiant lion and a most cunning fox; he will find him feared and respected by every one, and not hated by the army; and it need not be wondered at that he, a new man, was able to hold the empire so well, because his supreme renown always protected him from that hatred which the people might have conceived against him for his violence.',\n",
       "  'But his son Antoninus was a most eminent man, and had very excellent qualities, which made him admirable in the sight of the people and acceptable to the soldiers, for he was a warlike man, most enduring of fatigue, a despiser of all delicate food and other luxuries, which caused him to be beloved by the armies.',\n",
       "  'Nevertheless, his ferocity and cruelties were so great and so unheard of that, after endless single murders, he killed a large number of the people of Rome and all those of Alexandria. He became hated by the whole world, and also feared by those he had around him, to such an extent that he was murdered in the midst of his army by a centurion.',\n",
       "  'And here it must be noted that such-like deaths, which are deliberately inflicted with a resolved and desperate courage, cannot be avoided by princes, because any one who does not fear to die can inflict them; but a prince may fear them the less because they are very rare; he has only to be careful not to do any grave injury to those whom he employs or has around him in the service of the state.',\n",
       "  \"Antoninus had not taken this care, but had contumeliously killed a brother of that centurion, whom also he daily threatened, yet retained in his bodyguard; which, as it turned out, was a rash thing to do, and proved the emperor's ruin.\",\n",
       "  'But let us come to Commodus, to whom it should have been very easy to hold the empire, for, being the son of Marcus, he had inherited it, and he had only to follow in the footsteps of his father to please his people and soldiers; but, being by nature cruel and brutal, he gave himself up to amusing the soldiers and corrupting them, so that he might indulge his rapacity upon the people; on the other hand, not maintaining his dignity, often descending to the theatre to compete with gladiators, and doing other vile things, little worthy of the imperial majesty, he fell into contempt with the soldiers, and being hated by one party and despised by the other, he was conspired against and was killed.',\n",
       "  'It remains to discuss the character of Maximinus.',\n",
       "  'He was a very warlike man, and the armies, being disgusted with the effeminacy of Alexander, of whom I have already spoken, killed him and elected Maximinus to the throne. This he did not possess for long, for two things made him hated and despised; the one, his having kept sheep in Thrace, which brought him into contempt (it being well known to all, and considered a great indignity by every one), and the other, his having at the accession to his dominions deferred going to Rome and taking possession of the imperial seat; he had also gained a reputation for the utmost ferocity by having, through his prefects in Rome and elsewhere in the empire, practised many cruelties, so that the whole world was moved to anger at the meanness of his birth and to fear at his barbarity.',\n",
       "  'First Africa rebelled, then the Senate with all the people of Rome, and all Italy conspired against him, to which may be added his own army; this latter, besieging Aquileia and meeting with difficulties in taking it, were disgusted with his cruelties, and fearing him less when they found so many against him, murdered him.',\n",
       "  'I do not wish to discuss Heliogabalus, Macrinus, or Julian, who, being thoroughly contemptible, were quickly wiped out; but I will bring this discourse to a conclusion by saying that princes in our times have this difficulty of giving inordinate satisfaction to their soldiers in a far less degree, because, notwithstanding one has to give them some indulgence, that is soon done; none of these princes have armies that are veterans in the governance and administration of provinces, as were the armies of the Roman Empire; and whereas it was then more necessary to give satisfaction to the soldiers than to the people, it is now more necessary to all princes, except the Turk and the Soldan, to satisfy the people rather the soldiers, because the people are the more powerful.',\n",
       "  'From the above I have excepted the Turk, who always keeps round him twelve thousand infantry and fifteen thousand cavalry on which depend the security and strength of the kingdom, and it is necessary that, putting aside every consideration for the people, he should keep them his friends.',\n",
       "  'The kingdom of the Soldan is similar; being entirely in the hands of soldiers, it follows again that, without regard to the people, he must keep them his friends.',\n",
       "  'But you must note that the state of the Soldan is unlike all other principalities, for the reason that it is like the Christian pontificate, which cannot be called either an hereditary or a newly formed principality; because the sons of the old prince are not the heirs, but he who is elected to that position by those who have authority, and the sons remain only noblemen.',\n",
       "  'And this being an ancient custom, it cannot be called a new principality, because there are none of those difficulties in it that are met with in new ones; for although the prince is new, the constitution of the state is old, and it is framed so as to receive him as if he were its hereditary lord.',\n",
       "  'But returning to the subject of our discourse, I say that whoever will consider it will acknowledge that either hatred or contempt has been fatal to the above-named emperors, and it will be recognized also how it happened that, a number of them acting in one way and a number in another, only one in each way came to a happy end and the rest to unhappy ones.',\n",
       "  'Because it would have been useless and dangerous for Pertinax and Alexander, being new princes, to imitate Marcus, who was heir to the principality; and likewise it would have been utterly destructive to Caracalla, Commodus, and Maximinus to have imitated Severus, they not having sufficient valour to enable them to tread in his footsteps.',\n",
       "  'Therefore a prince, new to the principality, cannot imitate the actions of Marcus, nor, again, is it necessary to follow those of Severus, but he ought to take from Severus those parts which are necessary to found his state, and from Marcus those which are proper and glorious to keep a state that may already be stable and firm.',\n",
       "  '1. Some princes, so as to hold securely the state, have disarmed their subjects; others have kept their subject towns distracted by factions; others have fostered enmities against themselves; others have laid themselves out to gain over those whom they distrusted in the beginning of their governments; some have built fortresses; some have overthrown and destroyed them.',\n",
       "  'And although one cannot give a final judgment on all of these things unless one possesses the particulars of those states in which a decision has to be made, nevertheless I will speak as comprehensively as the matter of itself will admit.',\n",
       "  '2. There never was a new prince who has disarmed his subjects; rather when he has found them disarmed he has always armed them, because, by arming them, those arms become yours, those men who were distrusted become faithful, and those who were faithful are kept so, and your subjects become your adherents. And whereas all subjects cannot be armed, yet when those whom you do arm are benefited, the others can be handled more freely, and this difference in their treatment, which they quite understand, makes the former your dependents, and the latter, considering it to be necessary that those who have the most danger and service should have the most reward, excuse you. But when you disarm them, you at once offend them by showing that you distrust them, either for cowardice or for want of loyalty, and either of these opinions breeds hatred against you. And because you cannot remain unarmed, it follows that you turn to mercenaries, which are of the character already shown; even if they should be good they would not be sufficient to defend you against powerful enemies and distrusted subjects.',\n",
       "  'Therefore, as I have said, a new prince in a new principality has always distributed arms.',\n",
       "  'Histories are full of examples. But when a prince acquires a new state, which he adds as a province to his old one, then it is necessary to disarm the men of that state, except those who have been his adherents in acquiring it; and these again, with time and opportunity, should be rendered soft and effeminate; and matters should be managed in such a way that all the armed men in the state shall be your own soldiers who in your old state were living near you.',\n",
       "  '3. Our forefathers, and those who were reckoned wise, were accustomed to say that it was necessary to hold Pistoia by factions and Pisa by fortresses; and with this idea they fostered quarrels in some of their tributary towns so as to keep possession of them the more easily.',\n",
       "  'This may have been well enough in those times when Italy was in a way balanced, but I do not believe that it can be accepted as a precept for to-day, because I do not believe that factions can ever be of use; rather it is certain that when the enemy comes upon you in divided cities you are quickly lost, because the weakest party will always assist the outside forces and the other will not be able to resist.',\n",
       "  'The Venetians, moved, as I believe, by the above reasons, fostered the Guelph and Ghibelline factions in their tributary cities; and although they never allowed them to come to bloodshed, yet they nursed these disputes amongst them, so that the citizens, distracted by their differences, should not unite against them.',\n",
       "  'Which, as we saw, did not afterwards turn out as expected, because, after the rout at Vaila, one party at once took courage and seized the state.',\n",
       "  'Such methods argue, therefore, weakness in the prince, because these factions will never be permitted in a vigorous principality; such methods for enabling one the more easily to manage subjects are only useful in times of peace, but if war comes this policy proves fallacious.',\n",
       "  '4. Without doubt princes become great when they overcome the difficulties and obstacles by which they are confronted, and therefore fortune, especially when she desires to make a new prince great, who has a greater necessity to earn renown than an hereditary one, causes enemies to arise and form designs against him, in order that he may have the opportunity of overcoming them, and by them to mount higher, as by a ladder which his enemies have raised.',\n",
       "  'For this reason many consider that a wise prince, when he has the opportunity, ought with craft to foster some animosity against himself, so that, having crushed it, his renown may rise higher.',\n",
       "  '5. Princes, especially new ones, have found more fidelity and assistance in those men who in the beginning of their rule were distrusted than among those who in the beginning were trusted.',\n",
       "  'Pandolfo Petrucci, Prince of Siena, ruled his state more by those who had been distrusted than by others.',\n",
       "  'But on this question one cannot speak generally, for it varies so much with the individual; I will only say this, that those men who at the commencement of a princedom have been hostile, if they are of a description to need assistance to support themselves, can always be gained over with the greatest ease, and they will be tightly held to serve the prince with fidelity, inasmuch as they know it to be very necessary for them to cancel by deeds the bad impression which he had formed of them; and thus the prince always extracts more profit from them than from those who, serving him in too much security, may neglect his affairs.',\n",
       "  'And since the matter demands it, I must not fail to warn a prince, who by means of secret favours has acquired a new state, that he must well consider the reasons which induced those to favour him who did so; and if it be not a natural affection towards him, but only discontent with their government, then he will only keep them friendly with great trouble and difficulty, for it will be impossible to satisfy them.',\n",
       "  'And weighing well the reasons for this in those examples which can be taken from ancient and modern affairs, we shall find that it is easier for the prince to make friends of those men who were contented under the former government, and are therefore his enemies, than of those who, being discontented with it, were favourable to him and encouraged him to seize it.',\n",
       "  '6. It has been a custom with princes, in order to hold their states more securely, to build fortresses that may serve as a bridle and bit to those who might design to work against them, and as a place of refuge from a first attack.',\n",
       "  'I praise this system because it has been made use of formerly.',\n",
       "  'Notwithstanding that, Messer Nicolo Vitelli in our times has been seen to demolish two fortresses in Citta di Castello so that he might keep that state; Guido Ubaldo, Duke of Urbino, on returning to his dominion, whence he had been driven by Cesare Borgia, razed to the foundations all the fortresses in that province, and considered that without them it would be more difficult to lose it; the Bentivogli returning to Bologna came to a similar decision.',\n",
       "  'Fortresses, therefore, are useful or not according to circumstances; if they do you good in one way they injure you in another.',\n",
       "  'And this question can be reasoned thus: the prince who has more to fear from the people than from foreigners ought to build fortresses, but he who has more to fear from foreigners than from the people ought to leave them alone.',\n",
       "  'The castle of Milan, built by Francesco Sforza, has made, and will make, more trouble for the house of Sforza than any other disorder in the state.',\n",
       "  'For this reason the best possible fortress is--not to be hated by the people, because, although you may hold the fortresses, yet they will not save you if the people hate you, for there will never be wanting foreigners to assist a people who have taken arms against you.',\n",
       "  'It has not been seen in our times that such fortresses have been of use to any prince, unless to the Countess of Forli,(*) when the Count Girolamo, her consort, was killed; for by that means she was able to withstand the popular attack and wait for assistance from Milan, and thus recover her state; and the posture of affairs was such at that time that the foreigners could not assist the people.',\n",
       "  'But fortresses were of little value to her afterwards when Cesare Borgia attacked her, and when the people, her enemy, were allied with foreigners. Therefore, it would have been safer for her, both then and before, not to have been hated by the people than to have had the fortresses.',\n",
       "  'All these things considered then, I shall praise him who builds fortresses as well as him who does not, and I shall blame whoever, trusting in them, cares little about being hated by the people.',\n",

In either case it will always be more advantageous for you to declare yourself and to make war strenuously; because, in the first case, if you do not declare yourself, you will invariably fall a prey to the conqueror, to the pleasure and satisfaction of him who has been conquered, and you will have no reasons to offer, nor anything to protect or to shelter you.',\n",

       "  'The Duke Valentino had returned from Lombardy, where he had been to clear himself with the King of France from the calumnies which had been raised against him by the Florentines concerning the rebellion of Arezzo and other towns in the Val di Chiana, and had arrived at Imola, whence he intended with his army to enter upon the campaign against Giovanni Bentivogli, the tyrant of Bologna: for he intended to bring that city under his domination, and to make it the head of his Romagnian duchy.',\n",
       "  'These matters coming to the knowledge of the Vitelli and Orsini and their following, it appeared to them that the duke would become too powerful, and it was feared that, having seized Bologna, he would seek to destroy them in order that he might become supreme in Italy.',\n",
       "  'Upon this a meeting was called at Magione in the district of Perugia, to which came the cardinal, Pagolo, and the Duke di Gravina Orsini, Vitellozzo Vitelli, Oliverotto da Fermo, Gianpagolo Baglioni, the tyrant of Perugia, and Messer Antonio da Venafro, sent by Pandolfo Petrucci, the Prince of Siena.',\n",
       "  'Here were discussed the power and courage of the duke and the necessity of curbing his ambitions, which might otherwise bring danger to the rest of being ruined.',\n",
       "  'And they decided not to abandon the Bentivogli, but to strive to win over the Florentines; and they sent their men to one place and another, promising to one party assistance and to another encouragement to unite with them against the common enemy.',\n",
       "  'This meeting was at once reported throughout all Italy, and those who were discontented under the duke, among whom were the people of Urbino, took hope of effecting a revolution.',\n",
       "  \"Thus it arose that, men's minds being thus unsettled, it was decided by certain men of Urbino to seize the fortress of San Leo, which was held for the duke, and which they captured by the following means.\",\n",
       "  'The castellan was fortifying the rock and causing timber to be taken there; so the conspirators watched, and when certain beams which were being carried to the rock were upon the bridge, so that it was prevented from being drawn up by those inside, they took the opportunity of leaping upon the bridge and thence into the fortress.',\n",
       "  'Upon this capture being effected, the whole state rebelled and recalled the old duke, being encouraged in this, not so much by the capture of the fort, as by the Diet at Magione, from whom they expected to get assistance.',\n",
       "  'Those who heard of the rebellion at Urbino thought they would not lose the opportunity, and at once assembled their men so as to take any town, should any remain in the hands of the duke in that state; and they sent again to Florence to beg that republic to join with them in destroying the common firebrand, showing that the risk was lessened and that they ought not to wait for another opportunity.',\n",
       "  'But the Florentines, from hatred, for sundry reasons, of the Vitelli and Orsini, not only would not ally themselves, but sent Nicolo Machiavelli, their secretary, to offer shelter and assistance to the duke against his enemies.',\n",
       "  \"The duke was found full of fear at Imola, because, against everybody's expectation, his soldiers had at once gone over to the enemy and he found himself disarmed and war at his door.\",\n",
       "  'But recovering courage from the offers of the Florentines, he decided to temporize before fighting with the few soldiers that remained to him, and to negotiate for a reconciliation, and also to get assistance.',\n",
       "  'This latter he obtained in two ways, by sending to the King of France for men and by enlisting men-at-arms and others whom he turned into cavalry of a sort: to all he gave money.',\n",
       "  'Notwithstanding this, his enemies drew near to him, and approached Fossombrone, where they encountered some men of the duke and, with the aid of the Orsini and Vitelli, routed them.',\n",
       "  'When this happened, the duke resolved at once to see if he could not close the trouble with offers of reconciliation, and being a most perfect dissembler he did not fail in any practices to make the insurgents understand that he wished every man who had acquired anything to keep it, as it was enough for him to have the title of prince, whilst others might have the principality.',\n",
       "  'And the duke succeeded so well in this that they sent Signor Pagolo to him to negotiate for a reconciliation, and they brought their army to a standstill.',\n",
       "  'But the duke did not stop his preparations, and took every care to provide himself with cavalry and infantry, and that such preparations might not be apparent to the others, he sent his troops in separate parties to every part of the Romagna.',\n",
       "  'In the meanwhile there came also to him five hundred French lancers, and although he found himself sufficiently strong to take vengeance on his enemies in open war, he considered that it would be safer and more advantageous to outwit them, and for this reason he did not stop the work of reconciliation.',\n",
       "  'And that this might be effected the duke concluded a peace with them in which he confirmed their former covenants; he gave them four thousand ducats at once; he promised not to injure the Bentivogli; and he formed an alliance with Giovanni; and moreover he would not force them to come personally into his presence unless it pleased them to do so.',\n",
       "  'On the other hand, they promised to restore to him the duchy of Urbino and other places seized by them, to serve him in all his expeditions, and not to make war against or ally themselves with any one without his permission.',\n",
       "  'This reconciliation being completed, Guido Ubaldo, the Duke of Urbino, again fled to Venice, having first destroyed all the fortresses in his state; because, trusting in the people, he did not wish that the fortresses, which he did not think he could defend, should be held by the enemy, since by these means a check would be kept upon his friends.',\n",
       "  'But the Duke Valentino, having completed this convention, and dispersed his men throughout the Romagna, set out for Imola at the end of November together with his French men-at-arms: thence he went to Cesena, where he stayed some time to negotiate with the envoys of the Vitelli and Orsini, who had assembled with their men in the duchy of Urbino, as to the enterprise in which they should now take part; but nothing being concluded, Oliverotto da Fermo was sent to propose that if the duke wished to undertake an expedition against Tuscany they were ready; if he did not wish it, then they would besiege Sinigalia.',\n",
       "  'To this the duke replied that he did not wish to enter into war with Tuscany, and thus become hostile to the Florentines, but that he was very willing to proceed against Sinigalia.',\n",
       "  'It happened that not long afterwards the town surrendered, but the fortress would not yield to them because the castellan would not give it up to any one but the duke in person; therefore they exhorted him to come there.',\n",
       "  'This appeared a good opportunity to the duke, as, being invited by them, and not going of his own will, he would awaken no suspicions. And the more to reassure them, he allowed all the French men-at-arms who were with him in Lombardy to depart, except the hundred lancers under Mons. di Candales, his brother-in-law.',\n",
       "  'He left Cesena about the middle of December, and went to Fano, and with the utmost cunning and cleverness he persuaded the Vitelli and Orsini to wait for him at Sinigalia, pointing out to them that any lack of compliance would cast a doubt upon the sincerity and permanency of the reconciliation, and that he was a man who wished to make use of the arms and councils of his friends.',\n",
       "  'But Vitellozzo remained very stubborn, for the death of his brother warned him that he should not offend a prince and afterwards trust him; nevertheless, persuaded by Pagolo Orsini, whom the duke had corrupted with gifts and promises, he agreed to wait.',\n",
       "  \"Upon this the duke, before his departure from Fano, which was to be on 30th December 1502, communicated his designs to eight of his most trusted followers, among whom were Don Michele and the Monsignor d'Euna, who was afterwards cardinal; and he ordered that, as soon as Vitellozzo, Pagolo Orsini, the Duke di Gravina, and Oliverotto should arrive, his followers in pairs should take them one by one, entrusting certain men to certain pairs, who should entertain them until they reached Sinigalia; nor should they be permitted to leave until they came to the duke's quarters, where they should be seized.\",\n",
       "  'The duke afterwards ordered all his horsemen and infantry, of which there were more than two thousand cavalry and ten thousand footmen, to assemble by daybreak at the Metauro, a river five miles distant from Fano, and await him there.',\n",
       "  'He found himself, therefore, on the last day of December at the Metauro with his men, and having sent a cavalcade of about two hundred horsemen before him, he then moved forward the infantry, whom he accompanied with the rest of the men-at-arms.',\n",
       "  'Fano and Sinigalia are two cities of La Marca situated on the shore of the Adriatic Sea, fifteen miles distant from each other, so that he who goes towards Sinigalia has the mountains on his right hand, the bases of which are touched by the sea in some places.',\n",
       "  'The city of Sinigalia is distant from the foot of the mountains a little more than a bow-shot and from the shore about a mile.',\n",
       "  'On the side opposite to the city runs a little river which bathes that part of the walls looking towards Fano, facing the high road.',\n",
       "  'Thus he who draws near to Sinigalia comes for a good space by road along the mountains, and reaches the river which passes by Sinigalia.',\n",
       "  'If he turns to his left hand along the bank of it, and goes for the distance of a bow-shot, he arrives at a bridge which crosses the river; he is then almost abreast of the gate that leads into Sinigalia, not by a straight line, but transversely.',\n",
       "  'Before this gate there stands a collection of houses with a square to which the bank of the river forms one side.',\n",
       "  'The Vitelli and Orsini having received orders to wait for the duke, and to honour him in person, sent away their men to several castles distant from Sinigalia about six miles, so that room could be made for the men of the duke; and they left in Sinigalia only Oliverotto and his band, which consisted of one thousand infantry and one hundred and fifty horsemen, who were quartered in the suburb mentioned above.',\n",
       "  'Matters having been thus arranged, the Duke Valentino left for Sinigalia, and when the leaders of the cavalry reached the bridge they did not pass over, but having opened it, one portion wheeled towards the river and the other towards the country, and a way was left in the middle through which the infantry passed, without stopping, into the town.',\n",
       "  'Vitellozzo, Pagolo, and the Duke di Gravina on mules, accompanied by a few horsemen, went towards the duke; Vitellozo, unarmed and wearing a cape lined with green, appeared very dejected, as if conscious of his approaching death--a circumstance which, in view of the ability of the man and his former fortune, caused some amazement.',\n",
       "  'And it is said that when he parted from his men before setting out for Sinigalia to meet the duke he acted as if it were his last parting from them.',\n",
       "  'He recommended his house and its fortunes to his captains, and advised his nephews that it was not the fortune of their house, but the virtues of their fathers that should be kept in mind.',\n",
       "  'These three, therefore, came before the duke and saluted him respectfully, and were received by him with goodwill; they were at once placed between those who were commissioned to look after them.',\n",
       "  'But the duke noticing that Oliverotto, who had remained with his band in Sinigalia, was missing--for Oliverotto was waiting in the square before his quarters near the river, keeping his men in order and drilling them--signalled with his eye to Don Michelle, to whom the care of Oliverotto had been committed, that he should take measures that Oliverotto should not escape.',\n",
       "  'Therefore Don Michele rode off and joined Oliverotto, telling him that it was not right to keep his men out of their quarters, because these might be taken up by the men of the duke; and he advised him to send them at once to their quarters and to come himself to meet the duke.',\n",
       "  'And Oliverotto, having taken this advice, came before the duke, who, when he saw him, called to him; and Oliverotto, having made his obeisance, joined the others.',\n",
       "  \"So the whole party entered Sinigalia, dismounted at the duke's quarters, and went with him into a secret chamber, where the duke made them prisoners; he then mounted on horseback, and issued orders that the men of Oliverotto and the Orsini should be stripped of their arms.\",\n",
       "  'Those of Oliverotto, being at hand, were quickly settled, but those of the Orsini and Vitelli, being at a distance, and having a presentiment of the destruction of their masters, had time to prepare themselves, and bearing in mind the valour and discipline of the Orsinian and Vitellian houses, they stood together against the hostile forces of the country and saved themselves.',\n",
       "  \"But the duke's soldiers, not being content with having pillaged the men of Oliverotto, began to sack Sinigalia, and if the duke had not repressed this outrage by killing some of them they would have completely sacked it.\",\n",
       "  'Night having come and the tumult being silenced, the duke prepared to kill Vitellozzo and Oliverotto; he led them into a room and caused them to be strangled.',\n",
       "  'Neither of them used words in keeping with their past lives:',\n",
       "  'Vitellozzo prayed that he might ask of the pope full pardon for his sins; Oliverotto cringed and laid the blame for all injuries against the duke on Vitellozzo.',\n",
       "  'Pagolo and the Duke di Gravina Orsini were kept alive until the duke heard from Rome that the pope had taken the Cardinal Orsino, the Archbishop of Florence, and Messer Jacopo da Santa Croce.',\n",
       "  'After which news, on 18th January 1502, in the castle of Pieve, they also were strangled in the same way.',\n",
       "  'It appears, dearest Zanobi and Luigi, a wonderful thing to those who have considered the matter, that all men, or the larger number of them, who have performed great deeds in the world, and excelled all others in their day, have had their birth and beginning in baseness and obscurity; or have been aggrieved by Fortune in some outrageous way.',\n",
       "  'They have either been exposed to the mercy of wild beasts, or they have had so mean a parentage that in shame they have given themselves out to be sons of Jove or of some other deity.',\n",

       "  'I believe that these lowly beginnings of great men occur because Fortune is desirous of showing to the world that such men owe much to her and little to wisdom, because she begins to show her hand when wisdom can really take no part in their career: thus all success must be attributed to her.',\n",
       "  'Castruccio Castracani of Lucca was one of those men who did great deeds, if he is measured by the times in which he lived and the city in which he was born; but, like many others, he was neither fortunate nor distinguished in his birth, as the course of this history will show.',\n",
       "  'It appeared to be desirable to recall his memory, because I have discerned in him such indications of valour and fortune as should make him a great exemplar to men.',\n",

       "  'One morning, shortly after sunrise, Madonna Dianora, as the sister of Messer Antonio was called, had occasion to go into the vineyard as usual to gather herbs for seasoning the dinner, and hearing a slight rustling among the leaves of a vine she turned her eyes in that direction, and heard something resembling the cry of an infant.',\n",
       "  'Whereupon she went towards it, and saw the hands and face of a baby who was lying enveloped in the leaves and who seemed to be crying for its mother.',\n",
       "  'Partly wondering and partly fearing, yet full of compassion, she lifted it up and carried it to the house, where she washed it and clothed it with clean linen as is customary, and showed it to Messer Antonio when he returned home.',\n",

       "  'As soon as Castruccio reached the age of fourteen he began to take less notice of the chiding of Messer Antonio and Madonna Dianora and no longer to fear them; he left off reading ecclesiastical books, and turned to playing with arms, delighting in nothing so much as in learning their uses, and in running, leaping, and wrestling with other boys.',\n",
       "  'In all exercises he far excelled his companions in courage and bodily strength, and if at any time he did turn to books, only those pleased him which told of wars and the mighty deeds of men.',\n",

       "  'He had often fought under the command of the Visconti of Milan, and as a Ghibelline was the valued leader of that party in Lucca.',\n",
       "  'This gentleman resided in Lucca and was accustomed to assemble with others most mornings and evenings under the balcony of the Podesta, which is at the top of the square of San Michele, the finest square in Lucca, and he had often seen Castruccio taking part with other children of the street in those games of which I have spoken.',\n",
       "  'Noticing that Castruccio far excelled the other boys, and that he appeared to exercise a royal authority over them, and that they loved and obeyed him, Messer Francesco became greatly desirous of learning who he was.',\n",
       "  'Being informed of the circumstances of the bringing up of Castruccio he felt a greater desire to have him near to him. Therefore he called him one day and asked him whether he would more willingly live in the house of a gentleman, where he would learn to ride horses and use arms, or in the house of a priest, where he would learn nothing but masses and the services of the Church.',\n",
       "  'Messer Francesco could see that it pleased Castruccio greatly to hear horses and arms spoken of, even though he stood silent, blushing modestly; but being encouraged by Messer Francesco to speak, he answered that, if his master were agreeable, nothing would please him more than to give up his priestly studies and take up those of a soldier.',\n",
       "  'This reply delighted Messer Francesco, and in a very short time he obtained the consent of Messer Antonio, who was driven to yield by his knowledge of the nature of the lad, and the fear that he would not be able to hold him much longer.',\n",
       "  'Thus Castruccio passed from the house of Messer Antonio the priest to the house of Messer Francesco Guinigi the soldier, and it was astonishing to find that in a very short time he manifested all that virtue and bearing which we are accustomed to associate with a true gentleman.',\n",
       "  'In the first place he became an accomplished horseman, and could manage with ease the most fiery charger, and in all jousts and tournaments, although still a youth, he was observed beyond all others, and he excelled in all exercises of strength and dexterity.',\n",
       "  'But what enhanced so much the charm of these accomplishments, was the delightful modesty which enabled him to avoid offence in either act or word to others, for he was deferential to the great men, modest with his equals, and courteous to his inferiors.',\n",

       "  'Upon the death of Francesco, Castruccio became the governor and tutor of Pagolo, which increased enormously his power and position, and created a certain amount of envy against him in Lucca in place of the former universal goodwill, for many men suspected him of harbouring tyrannical intentions.',\n",
       "  'Among these the leading man was Giorgio degli Opizi, the head of the Guelph party.',\n",
       "  'This man hoped after the death of Messer Francesco to become the chief man in Lucca, but it seemed to him that Castruccio, with the great abilities which he already showed, and holding the position of governor, deprived him of his opportunity; therefore he began to sow those seeds which should rob Castruccio of his eminence.',\n",
       "  'Castruccio at first treated this with scorn, but afterwards he grew alarmed, thinking that Messer Giorgio might be able to bring him into disgrace with the deputy of King Ruberto of Naples and have him driven out of Lucca.',\n",

       "  'Uguccione, finding himself growing worse, went to Montecarlo to be cured, and left the command of the army in the hands of Castruccio.',\n",
       "  'This change brought about the ruin of the Guelphs, who, thinking that the hostile army having lost its captain had lost its head, grew over-confident.',\n",
       "  'Castruccio observed this, and allowed some days to pass in order to encourage this belief; he also showed signs of fear, and did not allow any of the munitions of the camp to be used.',\n",
       "  'On the other side, the Guelphs grew more insolent the more they saw these evidences of fear, and every day they drew out in the order of battle in front of the army of Castruccio.',\n",
       "  'Presently, deeming that the enemy was sufficiently emboldened, and having mastered their tactics, he decided to join battle with them.',\n",
       "  'First he spoke a few words of encouragement to his soldiers, and pointed out to them the certainty of victory if they would but obey his commands.',\n",
       "  'Castruccio had noticed how the enemy had placed all his best troops in the centre of the line of battle, and his less reliable men on the wings of the army; whereupon he did exactly the opposite, putting his most valiant men on the flanks, while those on whom he could not so strongly rely he moved to the centre.',\n",
       "  'Observing this order of battle, he drew out of his lines and quickly came in sight of the hostile army, who, as usual, had come in their insolence to defy him.',\n",
       "  'He then commanded his centre squadrons to march slowly, whilst he moved rapidly forward those on the wings.',\n",
       "  'Thus, when they came into contact with the enemy, only the wings of the two armies became engaged, whilst the center battalions remained out of action, for these two portions of the line of battle were separated from each other by a long interval and thus unable to reach each other.',\n",

       "  'The lord of Serravalle was Manfred, a German, who, before Castruccio became lord of Pistoia, had been allowed to remain in possession of the castle, it being common to the Lucchese and the Pistoians, and unclaimed by either--neither of them wishing to displace Manfred as long as he kept his promise of neutrality, and came under obligations to no one.',\n",
       "  'For these reasons, and also because the castle was well fortified, he had always been able to maintain his position.',\n",
       "  'It was here that Castruccio had determined to fall upon his enemy, for here his few men would have the advantage, and there was no fear lest, seeing the large masses of the hostile force before they became engaged, they should not stand.',\n",
       "  'As soon as this trouble with Florence arose, Castruccio saw the immense advantage which possession of this castle would give him, and having an intimate friendship with a resident in the castle, he managed matters so with him that four hundred of his men were to be admitted into the castle the night before the attack on the Florentines, and the castellan put to death.',\n",
       "  'Castruccio, having prepared everything, had now to encourage the Florentines to persist in their desire to carry the seat of war away from Pistoia into the Val di Nievole, therefore he did not move his army from Montecarlo.',\n",
       "  'Thus the Florentines hurried on until they reached their encampment under Serravalle, intending to cross the hill on the following morning.',\n",
       "  'In the meantime, Castruccio had seized the castle at night, had also moved his army from Montecarlo, and marching from thence at midnight in dead silence, had reached the foot of Serravalle: thus he and the Florentines commenced the ascent of the hill at the same time in the morning.',\n",
       "  'Castruccio sent forward his infantry by the main road, and a troop of four hundred horsemen by a path on the left towards the castle.',\n",

       "  '\"That\\'s not a bad idea,\" said M. de Renal, who was obviously very delighted.',\n",
       "  '\"You will have to stipulate all the same,\" said Julien in that solemn and almost melancholy manner which suits some people so well when they see the realization of matters which they have desired for a long time past, \"you will have to stipulate that the servant should not take out any novels. Those dangerous books, once they got into the house, might corrupt Madame de Renal\\'s maids, and even the servant himself.\"',\n",

I suppose it comes from the fact that none of us can stand other people having the same faults as ourselves.  I quite sympathize with the rage of the English democracy against what they call the vices of the upper orders.

If one puts forward an idea to a true Englishman--always a rash thing to do--he never dreams of considering whether the idea is right or wrong. The only thing he considers of any importance is whether one believes it oneself.  Now, the value of an idea has nothing whatsoever to do with the sincerity of the man who expresses it.  Indeed, the probabilities are that the more insincere the man is, the more purely intellectual will the idea be, as in that case it will not be coloured by either his wants, his desires, or his prejudices.',\n",

       "  'When Farmer Oak smiled, the corners of his mouth spread till they were within an unimportant distance of his ears, his eyes were reduced to chinks, and diverging wrinkles appeared round them, extending upon his countenance like the rays in a rudimentary sketch of the rising sun.',\n",
       "  'His Christian name was Gabriel, and on working days he was a young man of sound judgment, easy motions, proper dress, and general good character.',\n",
       "  'On Sundays he was a man of misty views, rather given to postponing, and hampered by his best clothes and umbrella: upon the whole, one who felt himself to occupy morally that vast middle space of Laodicean neutrality which lay between the Communion people of the parish and the drunken section,--that is, he went to church, but yawned privately by the time the congregation reached the Nicene creed, and thought of what there would be for dinner when he meant to be listening to the sermon.',\n",
       "  'Or, to state his character as it stood in the scale of public opinion, when his friends and critics were in tantrums, he was considered rather a bad man; when they were pleased, he was rather a good man; when they were neither, he was a man whose moral colour was a kind of pepper-and-salt mixture.',\n",
       "  \"Since he lived six times as many working-days as Sundays, Oak's appearance in his old clothes was most peculiarly his own--the mental picture formed by his neighbours in imagining him being always dressed in that way.\",\n",
       "  \"He wore a low-crowned felt hat, spread out at the base by tight jamming upon the head for security in high winds, and a coat like Dr. Johnson's; his lower extremities being encased in ordinary leather leggings and boots emphatically large, affording to each foot a roomy apartment so constructed that any wearer might stand in a river all day long and know nothing of damp--their maker being a conscientious man who endeavoured to compensate for any weakness in his cut by unstinted dimension and solidity.\",\n",
       "  'Mr. Oak carried about him, by way of watch, what may be called a small silver clock; in other words, it was a watch as to shape and intention, and a small clock as to size.',\n",
       "  \"This instrument being several years older than Oak's grandfather, had the peculiarity of going either too fast or not at all.\",\n",
       "  'The smaller of its hands, too, occasionally slipped round on the pivot, and thus, though the minutes were told with precision, nobody could be quite certain of the hour they belonged to.',\n",
       "  \"The stopping peculiarity of his watch Oak remedied by thumps and shakes, and he escaped any evil consequences from the other two defects by constant comparisons with and observations of the sun and stars, and by pressing his face close to the glass of his neighbours' windows, till he could discern the hour marked by the green-faced timekeepers within.\",\n",
       "  \"It may be mentioned that Oak's fob being difficult of access, by reason of its somewhat high situation in the waistband of his trousers (which also lay at a remote height under his waistcoat), the watch was as a necessity pulled out by throwing the body to one side, compressing the mouth and face to a mere mass of ruddy flesh on account of the exertion required, and drawing up the watch by its chain, like a bucket from a well.\",\n",
       "  'But some thoughtful persons, who had seen him walking across one of his fields on a certain December morning--sunny and exceedingly mild--might have regarded Gabriel Oak in other aspects than these.',\n",
       "  'In his face one might notice that many of the hues and curves of youth had tarried on to manhood: there even remained in his remoter crannies some relics of the boy.',\n",
       "  'His height and breadth would have been sufficient to make his presence imposing, had they been exhibited with due consideration.',\n",
       "  'But there is a way some men have, rural and urban alike, for which the mind is more responsible than flesh and sinew: it is a way of curtailing their dimensions by their manner of showing them.',\n",
       "  \"And from a quiet modesty that would have become a vestal, which seemed continually to impress upon him that he had no great claim on the world's room, Oak walked unassumingly and with a faintly perceptible bend, yet distinct from a bowing of the shoulders.\",\n",
       "  'This may be said to be a defect in an individual if he depends for his valuation more upon his appearance than upon his capacity to wear well, which Oak did not.',\n",
       "  'He had just reached the time of life at which \"young\" is ceasing to be the prefix of \"man\" in speaking of one.',\n",
       "  'He was at the brightest period of masculine growth, for his intellect and his emotions were clearly separated: he had passed the time during which the influence of youth indiscriminately mingles them in the character of impulse, and he had not yet arrived at the stage wherein they become united again, in the character of prejudice, by the influence of a wife and family.',\n",
       "  'In short, he was twenty-eight, and a bachelor.',\n",
       "  'The field he was in this morning sloped to a ridge called Norcombe Hill.',\n",
       "  'Through a spur of this hill ran the highway between Emminster and Chalk-Newton.',\n",
       "  'Casually glancing over the hedge, Oak saw coming down the incline before him an ornamental spring waggon, painted yellow and gaily marked, drawn by two horses, a waggoner walking alongside bearing a whip perpendicularly.',\n",
       "  'The waggon was laden with household goods and window plants, and on the apex of the whole sat a woman, young and attractive.',\n",
       "  'Gabriel had not beheld the sight for more than half a minute, when the vehicle was brought to a standstill just beneath his eyes.',\n",
       "  '\"The tailboard of the waggon is gone, Miss,\" said the waggoner.',\n",
       "  '\"Then I heard it fall,\" said the girl, in a soft, though not particularly low voice.',\n",
       "  '\"I heard a noise I could not account for when we were coming up the hill.\"',\n",
       "  '\"I\\'ll run back.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Do,\" she answered.',\n",
       "  \"The sensible horses stood--perfectly still, and the waggoner's steps sank fainter and fainter in the distance.\",\n",
       "  'The girl on the summit of the load sat motionless, surrounded by tables and chairs with their legs upwards, backed by an oak settle, and ornamented in front by pots of geraniums, myrtles, and cactuses, together with a caged canary--all probably from the windows of the house just vacated.',\n",
       "  'There was also a cat in a willow basket, from the partly-opened lid of which she gazed with half-closed eyes, and affectionately surveyed the small birds around.',\n",
       "  'The handsome girl waited for some time idly in her place, and the only sound heard in the stillness was the hopping of the canary up and down the perches of its prison.',\n",
       "  'Then she looked attentively downwards.',\n",
       "  'It was not at the bird, nor at the cat; it was at an oblong package tied in paper, and lying between them.',\n",
       "  'She turned her head to learn if the waggoner were coming.',\n",
       "  'He was not yet in sight; and her eyes crept back to the package, her thoughts seeming to run upon what was inside it.',\n",
       "  'At length she drew the article into her lap, and untied the paper covering; a small swing looking-glass was disclosed, in which she proceeded to survey herself attentively.',\n",
       "  'She parted her lips and smiled.',\n",
       "  'It was a fine morning, and the sun lighted up to a scarlet glow the crimson jacket she wore, and painted a soft lustre upon her bright face and dark hair.',\n",
       "  'The myrtles, geraniums, and cactuses packed around her were fresh and green, and at such a leafless season they invested the whole concern of horses, waggon, furniture, and girl with a peculiar vernal charm.',\n",
       "  'What possessed her to indulge in such a performance in the sight of the sparrows, blackbirds, and unperceived farmer who were alone its spectators,--whether the smile began as a factitious one, to test her capacity in that art,--nobody knows; it ended certainly in a real smile.',\n",
       "  'She blushed at herself, and seeing her reflection blush, blushed the more.',\n",
       "  'The change from the customary spot and necessary occasion of such an act--from the dressing hour in a bedroom to a time of travelling out of doors--lent to the idle deed a novelty it did not intrinsically possess.',\n",
       "  'The picture was a delicate one.',\n",
       "  \"Woman's prescriptive infirmity had stalked into the sunlight, which had clothed it in the freshness of an originality.\",\n",
       "  'A cynical inference was irresistible by Gabriel Oak as he regarded the scene, generous though he fain would have been.',\n",
       "  'There was no necessity whatever for her looking in the glass.',\n",
       "  'She did not adjust her hat, or pat her hair, or press a dimple into shape, or do one thing to signify that any such intention had been her motive in taking up the glass.',\n",
       "  'She simply observed herself as a fair product of Nature in the feminine kind, her thoughts seeming to glide into far-off though likely dramas in which men would play a part--vistas of probable triumphs--the smiles being of a phase suggesting that hearts were imagined as lost and won.',\n",
       "  'Still, this was but conjecture, and the whole series of actions was so idly put forth as to make it rash to assert that intention had any part in them at all.',\n",
       "  \"The waggoner's steps were heard returning.\",\n",
       "  'She put the glass in the paper, and the whole again into its place.',\n",
       "  'When the waggon had passed on, Gabriel withdrew from his point of espial, and descending into the road, followed the vehicle to the turnpike-gate some way beyond the bottom of the hill, where the object of his contemplation now halted for the payment of toll.',\n",
       "  'About twenty steps still remained between him and the gate, when he heard a dispute.',\n",

       "  'The red-jacketed and dark-haired maiden seemed to think so too, for she carelessly glanced over him, and told her man to drive on.',\n",
       "  'She might have looked her thanks to Gabriel on a minute scale, but she did not speak them; more probably she felt none, for in gaining her a passage he had lost her her point, and we know how women take a favour of that kind.',\n",

       "  'She had no side-saddle, and it was very apparent that a firm seat upon the smooth leather beneath her was unattainable sideways.',\n",
       "  'Springing to her accustomed perpendicular like a bowed sapling, and satisfying herself that nobody was in sight, she seated herself in the manner demanded by the saddle, though hardly expected of the woman, and trotted off in the direction of Tewnell Mill.',\n",
       "  'Oak was amused, perhaps a little astonished, and hanging up the hat in his hut, went again among his ewes.',\n",

       "  '\"No--no--I cannot.  Don\\'t press me any more--don\\'t.  I don\\'t love you--so \\'twould be ridiculous,\" she said, with a laugh.',\n",
       "  'No man likes to see his emotions the sport of a merry-go-round of skittishness.',\n",
       "  '\"Very well,\" said Oak, firmly, with the bearing of one who was going to give his days and nights to Ecclesiastes for ever.',\n",
       "  '\"Then I\\'ll ask you no more.\"',\n",
       "  'DEPARTURE OF BATHSHEBA--A PASTORAL TRAGEDY',\n",
       "  'The news which one day reached Gabriel, that Bathsheba Everdene had left the neighbourhood, had an influence upon him which might have surprised any who never suspected that the more emphatic the renunciation the less absolute its character.',\n",
       "  'It may have been observed that there is no regular path for getting out of love as there is for getting in.',\n",
       "  'Some people look upon marriage as a short cut that way, but it has been known to fail.',\n",
       "  \"Separation, which was the means that chance offered to Gabriel Oak by Bathsheba's disappearance, though effectual with people of certain humours, is apt to idealize the removed object with others--notably those whose affection, placid and regular as it may be, flows deep and long.\",\n",
       "  'Oak belonged to the even-tempered order of humanity, and felt the secret fusion of himself in Bathsheba to be burning with a finer flame now that she was gone--that was all.',\n",
       "  \"His incipient friendship with her aunt had been nipped by the failure of his suit, and all that Oak learnt of Bathsheba's movements was done indirectly.\",\n",
       "  'It appeared that she had gone to a place called Weatherbury, more than twenty miles off, but in what capacity--whether as a visitor, or permanently, he could not discover.',\n",
       "  'Gabriel had two dogs.',\n",
       "  \"George, the elder, exhibited an ebony-tipped nose, surrounded by a narrow margin of pink flesh, and a coat marked in random splotches approximating in colour to white and slaty grey; but the grey, after years of sun and rain, had been scorched and washed out of the more prominent locks, leaving them of a reddish-brown, as if the blue component of the grey had faded, like the indigo from the same kind of colour in Turner's pictures.\",\n",
       "  'In substance it had originally been hair, but long contact with sheep seemed to be turning it by degrees into wool of a poor quality and staple.',\n",
       "  'This dog had originally belonged to a shepherd of inferior morals and dreadful temper, and the result was that George knew the exact degrees of condemnation signified by cursing and swearing of all descriptions better than the wickedest old man in the neighbourhood.',\n",
       "  'Long experience had so precisely taught the animal the difference between such exclamations as \"Come in!\" and \"D---- ye, come in!\" that he knew to a hair\\'s breadth the rate of trotting back from the ewes\\' tails that each call involved, if a staggerer with the sheep crook was to be escaped.',\n",
       "  'Though old, he was clever and trustworthy still.',\n",
       "  \"The young dog, George's son, might possibly have been the image of his mother, for there was not much resemblance between him and George.\",\n",
       "  'He was learning the sheep-keeping business, so as to follow on at the flock when the other should die, but had got no further than the rudiments as yet--still finding an insuperable difficulty in distinguishing between doing a thing well enough and doing it too well.',\n",
       "  'So earnest and yet so wrong-headed was this young dog (he had no name in particular, and answered with perfect readiness to any pleasant interjection), that if sent behind the flock to help them on, he did it so thoroughly that he would have chased them across the whole county with the greatest pleasure if not called off or reminded when to stop by the example of old George.',\n",
       "  'Thus much for the dogs.',\n",
       "  'On the further side of Norcombe Hill was a chalk-pit, from which chalk had been drawn for generations, and spread over adjacent farms.',\n",
       "  'Two hedges converged upon it in the form of a V, but without quite meeting.',\n",
       "  'The narrow opening left, which was immediately over the brow of the pit, was protected by a rough railing.',\n",
       "  'One night, when Farmer Oak had returned to his house, believing there would be no further necessity for his attendance on the down, he called as usual to the dogs, previously to shutting them up in the outhouse till next morning.',\n",
       "  'Only one responded--old George; the other could not be found, either in the house, lane, or garden.',\n",
       "  'Gabriel then remembered that he had left the two dogs on the hill eating a dead lamb (a kind of meat he usually kept from them, except when other food ran short), and concluding that the young one had not finished his meal, he went indoors to the luxury of a bed, which latterly he had only enjoyed on Sundays.',\n",
       "  'It was a still, moist night.',\n",
       "  'Just before dawn he was assisted in waking by the abnormal reverberation of familiar music.',\n",
       "  'To the shepherd, the note of the sheep-bell, like the ticking of the clock to other people, is a chronic sound that only makes itself noticed by ceasing or altering in some unusual manner from the well-known idle twinkle which signifies to the accustomed ear, however distant, that all is well in the fold.',\n",
       "  'In the solemn calm of the awakening morn that note was heard by Gabriel, beating with unusual violence and rapidity.',\n",
       "  'This exceptional ringing may be caused in two ways--by the rapid feeding of the sheep bearing the bell, as when the flock breaks into new pasture, which gives it an intermittent rapidity, or by the sheep starting off in a run, when the sound has a regular palpitation.',\n",
       "  'The experienced ear of Oak knew the sound he now heard to be caused by the running of the flock with great velocity.',\n",
       "  'He jumped out of bed, dressed, tore down the lane through a foggy dawn, and ascended the hill.',\n",
       "  \"The forward ewes were kept apart from those among which the fall of lambs would be later, there being two hundred of the latter class in Gabriel's flock.\",\n",
       "  'These two hundred seemed to have absolutely vanished from the hill.',\n",
       "  'There were the fifty with their lambs, enclosed at the other end as he had left them, but the rest, forming the bulk of the flock, were nowhere.',\n",
       "  \"Gabriel called at the top of his voice the shepherd's call:\",\n",
       "  '\"Ovey, ovey, ovey!\"',\n",
       "  'Not a single bleat.',\n",
       "  'He went to the hedge; a gap had been broken through it, and in the gap were the footprints of the sheep.',\n",
       "  'Rather surprised to find them break fence at this season, yet putting it down instantly to their great fondness for ivy in winter-time, of which a great deal grew in the plantation, he followed through the hedge.',\n",
       "  'They were not in the plantation.',\n",
       "  'He called again: the valleys and farthest hills resounded as when the sailors invoked the lost Hylas on the Mysian shore; but no sheep.',\n",
       "  'He passed through the trees and along the ridge of the hill.',\n",
       "  'On the extreme summit, where the ends of the two converging hedges of which we have spoken were stopped short by meeting the brow of the chalk-pit, he saw the younger dog standing against the sky--dark and motionless as Napoleon at St. Helena.',\n",
       "  'A horrible conviction darted through Oak.',\n",
       "  'With a sensation of bodily faintness he advanced: at one point the rails were broken through, and there he saw the footprints of his ewes.',\n",
       "  'The dog came up, licked his hand, and made signs implying that he expected some great reward for signal services rendered.',\n",
       "  'Oak looked over the precipice.',\n",
       "  'The ewes lay dead and dying at its foot--a heap of two hundred mangled carcasses, representing in their condition just now at least two hundred more.',\n",
       "  'Oak was an intensely humane man: indeed, his humanity often tore in pieces any politic intentions of his which bordered on strategy, and carried him on as by gravitation.',\n",
       "  'A shadow in his life had always been that his flock ended in mutton--that a day came and found every shepherd an arrant traitor to his defenseless sheep.',\n",
       "  'His first feeling now was one of pity for the untimely fate of these gentle ewes and their unborn lambs.',\n",
       "  'It was a second to remember another phase of the matter.',\n",
       "  'The sheep were not insured.',\n",
       "  'All the savings of a frugal life had been dispersed at a blow; his hopes of being an independent farmer were laid low--possibly for ever.',\n",
       "  \"Gabriel's energies, patience, and industry had been so severely taxed during the years of his life between eighteen and eight-and-twenty, to reach his present stage of progress that no more seemed to be left in him.\",\n",
       "  'He leant down upon a rail, and covered his face with his hands.',\n",
       "  'Stupors, however, do not last for ever, and Farmer Oak recovered from his.',\n",
       "  'It was as remarkable as it was characteristic that the one sentence he uttered was in thankfulness:--',\n",
       "  '\"Thank God I am not married: what would SHE have done in the poverty now coming upon me!\"',\n",
       "  'Oak raised his head, and wondering what he could do, listlessly surveyed the scene.',\n",
       "  'By the outer margin of the Pit was an oval pond, and over it hung the attenuated skeleton of a chrome-yellow moon which had only a few days to last--the morning star dogging her on the left hand.',\n",
       "  \"The pool glittered like a dead man's eye, and as the world awoke a breeze blew, shaking and elongating the reflection of the moon without breaking it, and turning the image of the star to a phosphoric streak upon the water.\",\n",
       "  'All this Oak saw and remembered.',\n",
       "  'As far as could be learnt it appeared that the poor young dog, still under the impression that since he was kept for running after sheep, the more he ran after them the better, had at the end of his meal off the dead lamb, which may have given him additional energy and spirits, collected all the ewes into a corner, driven the timid creatures through the hedge, across the upper field, and by main force of worrying had given them momentum enough to break down a portion of the rotten railing, and so hurled them over the edge.',\n",
       "  \"George's son had done his work so thoroughly that he was considered too good a workman to live, and was, in fact, taken and tragically shot at twelve o'clock that same day--another instance of the untoward fate which so often attends dogs and other philosophers who follow out a train of reasoning to its logical conclusion, and attempt perfectly consistent conduct in a world made up so largely of compromise.\",\n",
       "  \"Gabriel's farm had been stocked by a dealer--on the strength of Oak's promising look and character--who was receiving a percentage from the farmer till such time as the advance should be cleared off.\",\n",
       "  'Oak found that the value of stock, plant, and implements which were really his own would be about sufficient to pay his debts, leaving himself a free man with the clothes he stood up in, and nothing more.',\n",
       "  'THE FAIR--THE JOURNEY--THE FIRE',\n",
       "  'Two months passed away.',\n",
       "  'We are brought on to a day in February, on which was held the yearly statute or hiring fair in the county-town of Casterbridge.',\n",
       "  'At one end of the street stood from two to three hundred blithe and hearty labourers waiting upon Chance--all men of the stamp to whom labour suggests nothing worse than a wrestle with gravitation, and pleasure nothing better than a renunciation of the same.',\n",
       "  'Among these, carters and waggoners were distinguished by having a piece of whip-cord twisted round their hats; thatchers wore a fragment of woven straw; shepherds held their sheep-crooks in their hands; and thus the situation required was known to the hirers at a glance.',\n",
       "  'In the crowd was an athletic young fellow of somewhat superior appearance to the rest--in fact, his superiority was marked enough to lead several ruddy peasants standing by to speak to him inquiringly, as to a farmer, and to use \"Sir\" as a finishing word.',\n",
       "  'His answer always was,--',\n",
       "  '\"I am looking for a place myself--a bailiff\\'s.  Do ye know of anybody who wants one?\"',\n",
       "  'Gabriel was paler now.  His eyes were more meditative, and his expression was more sad.',\n",
       "  'He had passed through an ordeal of wretchedness which had given him more than it had taken away.',\n",
       "  'He had sunk from his modest elevation as pastoral king into the very slime-pits of Siddim; but there was left to him a dignified calm he had never before known, and that indifference to fate which, though it often makes a villain of a man, is the basis of his sublimity when it does not.',\n",
       "  'And thus the abasement had been exaltation, and the loss gain.',\n",
       "  'In the morning a regiment of cavalry had left the town, and a sergeant and his party had been beating up for recruits through the four streets.',\n",
       "  'As the end of the day drew on, and he found himself not hired, Gabriel almost wished that he had joined them, and gone off to serve his country.',\n",
       "  'Weary of standing in the market-place, and not much minding the kind of work he turned his hand to, he decided to offer himself in some other capacity than that of bailiff.',\n",
       "  'All the farmers seemed to be wanting shepherds.',\n",
       "  \"Sheep-tending was Gabriel's speciality.\",\n",
       "  \"Turning down an obscure street and entering an obscurer lane, he went up to a smith's shop.\",\n",

       "  \"As the crook had absorbed most of Gabriel's money, he attempted, and carried out, an exchange of his overcoat for a shepherd's regulation smock-frock.\",\n",
       "  'This transaction having been completed, he again hurried off to the centre of the town, and stood on the kerb of the pavement, as a shepherd, crook in hand.',\n",
       "  'Now that Oak had turned himself into a shepherd, it seemed that bailiffs were most in demand.',\n",
       "  'However, two or three farmers noticed him and drew near.',\n",

       "  'It is safer to accept any chance that offers itself, and extemporize a procedure to fit it, than to get a good plan matured, and wait for a chance of using it.',\n",
       "  'Gabriel wished he had not nailed up his colours as a shepherd, but had laid himself out for anything in the whole cycle of labour that was required in the fair.',\n",

       "  'Oak could pipe with Arcadian sweetness, and the sound of the well-known notes cheered his own heart as well as those of the loungers.',\n",
       "  'He played on with spirit, and in half an hour had earned in pence what was a small fortune to a destitute man.',\n",
       "  'By making inquiries he learnt that there was another fair at Shottsford the next day.',\n",
       "  '\"How far is Shottsford?\"',\n",
       "  '\"Ten miles t\\'other side of Weatherbury.\"',\n",

       "  'If report spoke truly they were as hardy, merry, thriving, wicked a set as any in the whole county.',\n",

       "  'The road stretched through water-meadows traversed by little brooks, whose quivering surfaces were braided along their centres, and folded into creases at the sides; or, where the flow was more rapid, the stream was pied with spots of white froth, which rode on in undisturbed serenity.',\n",
       "  'On the higher levels the dead and dry carcasses of leaves tapped the ground as they bowled along helter-skelter upon the shoulders of the wind, and little birds in the hedges were rustling their feathers and tucking themselves in comfortably for the night, retaining their places if Oak kept moving, but flying away if he stopped to look at them.',\n",
       "  'He passed by Yalbury Wood where the game-birds were rising to their roosts, and heard the crack-voiced cock-pheasants \"cu-uck, cuck,\" and the wheezy whistle of the hens.',\n",
       "  'By the time he had walked three or four miles every shape in the landscape had assumed a uniform hue of blackness.',\n",
       "  'He descended Yalbury Hill and could just discern ahead of him a waggon, drawn up under a great over-hanging tree by the roadside.',\n",
       "  'On coming close, he found there were no horses attached to it, the spot being apparently quite deserted.',\n",
       "  'The waggon, from its position, seemed to have been left there for the night, for beyond about half a truss of hay which was heaped in the bottom, it was quite empty.',\n",
       "  'Gabriel sat down on the shafts of the vehicle and considered his position.',\n",
       "  'He calculated that he had walked a very fair proportion of the journey; and having been on foot since daybreak, he felt tempted to lie down upon the hay in the waggon instead of pushing on to the village of Weatherbury, and having to pay for a lodging.',\n",
       "  'Eating his last slices of bread and ham, and drinking from the bottle of cider he had taken the precaution to bring with him, he got into the lonely waggon.',\n",
       "  'Here he spread half of the hay as a bed, and, as well as he could in the darkness, pulled the other half over him by way of bed-clothes, covering himself entirely, and feeling, physically, as comfortable as ever he had been in his life.',\n",
       "  'Inward melancholy it was impossible for a man like Oak, introspective far beyond his neighbours, to banish quite, whilst conning the present untoward page of his history.',\n",
       "  'So, thinking of his misfortunes, amorous and pastoral, he fell asleep, shepherds enjoying, in common with sailors, the privilege of being able to summon the god instead of having to wait for him.',\n",
       "  'On somewhat suddenly awaking, after a sleep of whose length he had no idea, Oak found that the waggon was in motion.',\n",
       "  'He was being carried along the road at a rate rather considerable for a vehicle without springs, and under circumstances of physical uneasiness, his head being dandled up and down on the bed of the waggon like a kettledrum-stick.',\n",
       "  'He then distinguished voices in conversation, coming from the forpart of the waggon.',\n",
       "  'His concern at this dilemma (which would have been alarm, had he been a thriving man; but misfortune is a fine opiate to personal terror) led him to peer cautiously from the hay, and the first sight he beheld was the stars above him.',\n",
       "  \"Charles's Wain was getting towards a right angle with the Pole star, and Gabriel concluded that it must be about nine o'clock--in other words, that he had slept two hours.\",\n",

       "  'Two figures were dimly visible in front, sitting with their legs outside the waggon, one of whom was driving.',\n",
       "  'Gabriel soon found that this was the waggoner, and it appeared they had come from Casterbridge fair, like himself.',\n",

       "  'His weary face now began to be painted over with a rich orange glow, and the whole front of his smock-frock and gaiters was covered with a dancing shadow pattern of thorn-twigs--the light reaching him through a leafless intervening hedge--and the metallic curve of his sheep-crook shone silver-bright in the same abounding rays.',\n",
       "  'He came up to the boundary fence, and stood to regain breath.',\n",
       "  'It seemed as if the spot was unoccupied by a living soul.',\n",

       "  'Banks of smoke went off horizontally at the back like passing clouds, and behind these burned hidden pyres, illuminating the semi-transparent sheet of smoke to a lustrous yellow uniformity.',\n",
       "  'Individual straws in the foreground were consumed in a creeping movement of ruddy heat, as if they were knots of red worms, and above shone imaginary fiery faces, tongues hanging from lips, glaring eyes, and other impish forms, from which at intervals sparks flew in clusters like birds from a nest.',\n",
       "  'Oak suddenly ceased from being a mere spectator by discovering the case to be more serious than he had at first imagined.',\n",
       "  'A scroll of smoke blew aside and revealed to him a wheat-rick in startling juxtaposition with the decaying one, and behind this a series of others, composing the main corn produce of the farm; so that instead of the straw-stack standing, as he had imagined comparatively isolated, there was a regular connection between it and the remaining stacks of the group.',\n",

       "  \"No sooner was his father's funeral over, than Mrs. John Dashwood, without sending any notice of her intention to her mother-in-law, arrived with her child and their attendants.  No one could dispute her right to come; the house was her husband's from the moment of his father's decease; but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the greater, and to a woman in Mrs. Dashwood's situation, with only common feelings, must have been highly unpleasing;--but in HER mind there was a sense of honor so keen, a generosity so romantic, that any offence of the kind, by whomsoever given or received, was to her a source of immovable disgust.\",\n",
       "  \"Mrs. John Dashwood had never been a favourite with any of her husband's family; but she had had no opportunity, till the present, of shewing them with how little attention to the comfort of other people she could act when occasion required it.\",\n",
       "  'So acutely did Mrs. Dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour, and so earnestly did she despise her daughter-in-law for it, that, on the arrival of the latter, she would have quitted the house for ever, had not the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on the propriety of going, and her own tender love for all her three children determined her afterwards to stay, and for their sakes avoid a breach with their brother.',\n",
       "  'Elinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was so effectual, possessed a strength of understanding, and coolness of judgment, which qualified her, though only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her mother, and enabled her frequently to counteract, to the advantage of them all, that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood which must generally have led to imprudence.',\n",
       "  'She had an excellent heart;--her disposition was affectionate, and her feelings were strong; but she knew how to govern them: it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn; and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught.',\n",
       "  \"Marianne's abilities were, in many respects, quite equal to Elinor's. She was sensible and clever; but eager in everything: her sorrows, her joys, could have no moderation.  She was generous, amiable, interesting: she was everything but prudent.\",\n",
       "  'The resemblance between her and her mother was strikingly great.',\n",
       "  \"Elinor saw, with concern, the excess of her sister's sensibility; but by Mrs. Dashwood it was valued and cherished.\",\n",
       "  'They encouraged each other now in the violence of their affliction.',\n",
       "  'The agony of grief which overpowered them at first, was voluntarily renewed, was sought for, was created again and again.',\n",
       "  'They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it, and resolved against ever admitting consolation in future.',\n",
       "  'Elinor, too, was deeply afflicted; but still she could struggle, she could exert herself.  She could consult with her brother, could receive her sister-in-law on her arrival, and treat her with proper attention; and could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion, and encourage her to similar forbearance.',\n",
       "  \"Margaret, the other sister, was a good-humored, well-disposed girl; but as she had already imbibed a good deal of Marianne's romance, without having much of her sense, she did not, at thirteen, bid fair to equal her sisters at a more advanced period of life.\",\n",
       "  'Mrs. John Dashwood now installed herself mistress of Norland; and her mother and sisters-in-law were degraded to the condition of visitors.',\n",

       "  'He really pressed them, with some earnestness, to consider Norland as their home; and, as no plan appeared so eligible to Mrs. Dashwood as remaining there till she could accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood, his invitation was accepted.',\n",
       "  'A continuance in a place where everything reminded her of former delight, was exactly what suited her mind.',\n",

       "  'But in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy, and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was beyond alloy.',\n",
       "  'Mrs. John Dashwood did not at all approve of what her husband intended to do for his sisters.',\n",
       "  'To take three thousand pounds from the fortune of their dear little boy would be impoverishing him to the most dreadful degree.',\n",
       "  'She begged him to think again on the subject.',\n",
       "  'How could he answer it to himself to rob his child, and his only child too, of so large a sum?  And what possible claim could the Miss Dashwoods, who were related to him only by half blood, which she considered as no relationship at all, have on his generosity to so large an amount.',\n",
       "  'It was very well known that no affection was ever supposed to exist between the children of any man by different marriages; and why was he to ruin himself, and their poor little Harry, by giving away all his money to his half sisters?',\n",
       "  '\"It was my father\\'s last request to me,\" replied her husband, \"that I should assist his widow and daughters.\"',\n",
       "  '\"He did not know what he was talking of, I dare say; ten to one but he was light-headed at the time.  Had he been in his right senses, he could not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away half your fortune from your own child.\"',\n",
       "  '\"He did not stipulate for any particular sum, my dear Fanny; he only requested me, in general terms, to assist them, and make their situation more comfortable than it was in his power to do.  Perhaps it would have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself.  He could hardly suppose I should neglect them.  But as he required the promise, I could not do less than give it; at least I thought so at the time.',\n",
       "  'The promise, therefore, was given, and must be performed.  Something must be done for them whenever they leave Norland and settle in a new home.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Well, then, LET something be done for them; but THAT something need not be three thousand pounds.  Consider,\" she added, \"that when the money is once parted with, it never can return.  Your sisters will marry, and it will be gone for ever.  If, indeed, it could be restored to our poor little boy--\"',\n",
       "  '\"Why, to be sure,\" said her husband, very gravely, \"that would make great difference.  The time may come when Harry will regret that so large a sum was parted with.  If he should have a numerous family, for instance, it would be a very convenient addition.\"',\n",
       "  '\"To be sure it would.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Perhaps, then, it would be better for all parties, if the sum were diminished one half.--Five hundred pounds would be a prodigious increase to their fortunes!\"',\n",
       "  '\"Oh! beyond anything great!  What brother on earth would do half so much for his sisters, even if REALLY his sisters!  And as it is--only half blood!--But you have such a generous spirit!\"',\n",
       "  '\"I would not wish to do any thing mean,\" he replied.',\n",
       "  '\"One had rather, on such occasions, do too much than too little.  No one, at least, can think I have not done enough for them: even themselves, they can hardly expect more.\"',\n",
       "  '\"There is no knowing what THEY may expect,\" said the lady, \"but we are not to think of their expectations: the question is, what you can afford to do.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Certainly--and I think I may afford to give them five hundred pounds a-piece.  As it is, without any addition of mine, they will each have about three thousand pounds on their mother\\'s death--a very comfortable fortune for any young woman.\"',\n",
       "  '\"To be sure it is; and, indeed, it strikes me that they can want no addition at all.  They will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst them.  If they marry, they will be sure of doing well, and if they do not, they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of ten thousand pounds.\"',\n",
       "  '\"That is very true, and, therefore, I do not know whether, upon the whole, it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother while she lives, rather than for them--something of the annuity kind I mean.--My sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself. A hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable.\"',\n",
       "  'His wife hesitated a little, however, in giving her consent to this plan.',\n",
       "  '\"To be sure,\" said she, \"it is better than parting with fifteen hundred pounds at once.  But, then, if Mrs. Dashwood should live fifteen years we shall be completely taken in.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Fifteen years! my dear Fanny; her life cannot be worth half that purchase.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Certainly not; but if you observe, people always live for ever when there is an annuity to be paid them; and she is very stout and healthy, and hardly forty.  An annuity is a very serious business; it comes over and over every year, and there is no getting rid of it.  You are not aware of what you are doing.  I have known a great deal of the trouble of annuities; for my mother was clogged with the payment of three to old superannuated servants by my father\\'s will, and it is amazing how disagreeable she found it.  Twice every year these annuities were to be paid; and then there was the trouble of getting it to them; and then one of them was said to have died, and afterwards it turned out to be no such thing.  My mother was quite sick of it.  Her income was not her own, she said, with such perpetual claims on it; and it was the more unkind in my father, because, otherwise, the money would have been entirely at my mother\\'s disposal, without any restriction whatever.  It has given me such an abhorrence of annuities, that I am sure I would not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world.\"',\n",
       "  '\"It is certainly an unpleasant thing,\" replied Mr. Dashwood, \"to have those kind of yearly drains on one\\'s income.  One\\'s fortune, as your mother justly says, is NOT one\\'s own.  To be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum, on every rent day, is by no means desirable: it takes away one\\'s independence.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Undoubtedly; and after all you have no thanks for it.  They think themselves secure, you do no more than what is expected, and it raises no gratitude at all.  If I were you, whatever I did should be done at my own discretion entirely.  I would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly.  It may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred, or even fifty pounds from our own expenses.\"',\n",
       "  '\"I believe you are right, my love; it will be better that there should be no annuity in the case; whatever I may give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance, because they would only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger income, and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the year.  It will certainly be much the best way.  A present of fifty pounds, now and then, will prevent their ever being distressed for money, and will, I think, be amply discharging my promise to my father.\"',\n",
       "  '\"To be sure it will.  Indeed, to say the truth, I am convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at all.  The assistance he thought of, I dare say, was only such as might be reasonably expected of you; for instance, such as looking out for a comfortable small house for them, helping them to move their things, and sending them presents of fish and game, and so forth, whenever they are in season.  I\\'ll lay my life that he meant nothing farther; indeed, it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did.',\n",
       "  'Do but consider, my dear Mr. Dashwood, how excessively comfortable your mother-in-law and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds, besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls, which brings them in fifty pounds a year a-piece, and, of course, they will pay their mother for their board out of it.  Altogether, they will have five hundred a-year amongst them, and what on earth can four women want for more than that?--They will live so cheap! Their housekeeping will be nothing at all.  They will have no carriage, no horses, and hardly any servants; they will keep no company, and can have no expenses of any kind!  Only conceive how comfortable they will be!  Five hundred a year! I am sure I cannot imagine how they will spend half of it; and as to your giving them more, it is quite absurd to think of it.  They will be much more able to give YOU something.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Upon my word,\" said Mr. Dashwood, \"I believe you are perfectly right. My father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than what you say.  I clearly understand it now, and I will strictly fulfil my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you have described.  When my mother removes into another house my services shall be readily given to accommodate her as far as I can.  Some little present of furniture too may be acceptable then.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Certainly,\" returned Mrs. John Dashwood.',\n",
       "  '\"But, however, ONE thing must be considered.  When your father and mother moved to Norland, though the furniture of Stanhill was sold, all the china, plate, and linen was saved, and is now left to your mother.  Her house will therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it.\"',\n",
       "  '\"That is a material consideration undoubtedly.  A valuable legacy indeed! And yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Yes; and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what belongs to this house.  A great deal too handsome, in my opinion, for any place THEY can ever afford to live in.  But, however, so it is. Your father thought only of THEM.  And I must say this: that you owe no particular gratitude to him, nor attention to his wishes; for we very well know that if he could, he would have left almost everything in the world to THEM.\"',\n",
       "  'This argument was irresistible.  It gave to his intentions whatever of decision was wanting before; and he finally resolved, that it would be absolutely unnecessary, if not highly indecorous, to do more for the widow and children of his father, than such kind of neighbourly acts as his own wife pointed out.',\n",
       "  'Mrs. Dashwood remained at Norland several months; not from any disinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceased to raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while; for when her spirits began to revive, and her mind became capable of some other exertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholy remembrances, she was impatient to be gone, and indefatigable in her inquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of Norland; for to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible.',\n",
       "  'But she could hear of no situation that at once answered her notions of comfort and ease, and suited the prudence of her eldest daughter, whose steadier judgment rejected several houses as too large for their income, which her mother would have approved.',\n",
       "  'Mrs. Dashwood had been informed by her husband of the solemn promise on the part of his son in their favour, which gave comfort to his last earthly reflections.',\n",
       "  \"She doubted the sincerity of this assurance no more than he had doubted it himself, and she thought of it for her daughters' sake with satisfaction, though as for herself she was persuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000L would support her in affluence.\",\n",
       "  \"For their brother's sake, too, for the sake of his own heart, she rejoiced; and she reproached herself for being unjust to his merit before, in believing him incapable of generosity.\",\n",
       "  'His attentive behaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that their welfare was dear to him, and, for a long time, she firmly relied on the liberality of his intentions.',\n",
       "  \"The contempt which she had, very early in their acquaintance, felt for her daughter-in-law, was very much increased by the farther knowledge of her character, which half a year's residence in her family afforded; and perhaps in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal affection on the side of the former, the two ladies might have found it impossible to have lived together so long, had not a particular circumstance occurred to give still greater eligibility, according to the opinions of Mrs. Dashwood, to her daughters' continuance at Norland.\",\n",
       "  \"This circumstance was a growing attachment between her eldest girl and the brother of Mrs. John Dashwood, a gentleman-like and pleasing young man, who was introduced to their acquaintance soon after his sister's establishment at Norland, and who had since spent the greatest part of his time there.\",\n",
       "  'Some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from motives of interest, for Edward Ferrars was the eldest son of a man who had died very rich; and some might have repressed it from motives of prudence, for, except a trifling sum, the whole of his fortune depended on the will of his mother.',\n",
       "  'But Mrs. Dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either consideration.  It was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable, that he loved her daughter, and that Elinor returned the partiality.',\n",
       "  \"It was contrary to every doctrine of hers that difference of fortune should keep any couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance of disposition; and that Elinor's merit should not be acknowledged by every one who knew her, was to her comprehension impossible.\",\n",
       "  'Edward Ferrars was not recommended to their good opinion by any peculiar graces of person or address.  He was not handsome, and his manners required intimacy to make them pleasing.  He was too diffident to do justice to himself; but when his natural shyness was overcome, his behaviour gave every indication of an open, affectionate heart. His understanding was good, and his education had given it solid improvement.  But he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition to answer the wishes of his mother and sister, who longed to see him distinguished--as--they hardly knew what.  They wanted him to make a fine figure in the world in some manner or other.',\n",
       "  'His mother wished to interest him in political concerns, to get him into parliament, or to see him connected with some of the great men of the day.',\n",
       "  'Mrs. John Dashwood wished it likewise; but in the mean while, till one of these superior blessings could be attained, it would have quieted her ambition to see him driving a barouche.',\n",
       "  'But Edward had no turn for great men or barouches.  All his wishes centered in domestic comfort and the quiet of private life.',\n",
       "  'Fortunately he had a younger brother who was more promising.',\n",
       "  \"Edward had been staying several weeks in the house before he engaged much of Mrs. Dashwood's attention; for she was, at that time, in such affliction as rendered her careless of surrounding objects.  She saw only that he was quiet and unobtrusive, and she liked him for it.\",\n",
       "  'He did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by ill-timed conversation.',\n",
       "  'She was first called to observe and approve him farther, by a reflection which Elinor chanced one day to make on the difference between him and his sister.',\n",
       "  'It was a contrast which recommended him most forcibly to her mother.',\n",
       "  '\"It is enough,\" said she; \"to say that he is unlike Fanny is enough. It implies everything amiable.  I love him already.\"',\n",
       "  '\"I think you will like him,\" said Elinor, \"when you know more of him.\"',\n",

       "  'No sooner did she perceive any symptom of love in his behaviour to Elinor, than she considered their serious attachment as certain, and looked forward to their marriage as rapidly approaching.',\n",

       "  '\"My love, it will be scarcely a separation.  We shall live within a few miles of each other, and shall meet every day of our lives.  You will gain a brother, a real, affectionate brother.  I have the highest opinion in the world of Edward\\'s heart.  But you look grave, Marianne; do you disapprove your sister\\'s choice?\"',\n",
       "  '\"Perhaps,\" said Marianne, \"I may consider it with some surprise. Edward is very amiable, and I love him tenderly.  But yet--he is not the kind of young man--there is something wanting--his figure is not striking; it has none of that grace which I should expect in the man who could seriously attach my sister.  His eyes want all that spirit, that fire, which at once announce virtue and intelligence.  And besides all this, I am afraid, Mama, he has no real taste.  Music seems scarcely to attract him, and though he admires Elinor\\'s drawings very much, it is not the admiration of a person who can understand their worth.  It is evident, in spite of his frequent attention to her while she draws, that in fact he knows nothing of the matter.  He admires as a lover, not as a connoisseur.',\n",
       "  'To satisfy me, those characters must be united.  I could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every point coincide with my own.  He must enter into all my feelings; the same books, the same music must charm us both.',\n",
       "  \"Oh! mama, how spiritless, how tame was Edward's manner in reading to us last night!\",\n",
       "  'I felt for my sister most severely.  Yet she bore it with so much composure, she seemed scarcely to notice it.',\n",
       "  'I could hardly keep my seat.  To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild, pronounced with such impenetrable calmness, such dreadful indifference!\"',\n",
       "  '\"He would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose. I thought so at the time; but you WOULD give him Cowper.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Nay, Mama, if he is not to be animated by Cowper!--but we must allow for difference of taste.  Elinor has not my feelings, and therefore she may overlook it, and be happy with him.  But it would have broke MY heart, had I loved him, to hear him read with so little sensibility.',\n",
       "  'Mama, the more I know of the world, the more am I convinced that I shall never see a man whom I can really love.  I require so much!  He must have all Edward\\'s virtues, and his person and manners must ornament his goodness with every possible charm.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Remember, my love, that you are not seventeen.  It is yet too early in life to despair of such a happiness.  Why should you be less fortunate than your mother?  In one circumstance only, my Marianne, may your destiny be different from hers!\"',\n",
       "  '\"What a pity it is, Elinor,\" said Marianne, \"that Edward should have no taste for drawing.\"',\n",
       "  '\"No taste for drawing!\" replied Elinor, \"why should you think so? He does not draw himself, indeed, but he has great pleasure in seeing the performances of other people, and I assure you he is by no means deficient in natural taste, though he has not had opportunities of improving it.  Had he ever been in the way of learning, I think he would have drawn very well.  He distrusts his own judgment in such matters so much, that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on any picture; but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste, which in general direct him perfectly right.\"',\n",
       "  'Marianne was afraid of offending, and said no more on the subject; but the kind of approbation which Elinor described as excited in him by the drawings of other people, was very far from that rapturous delight, which, in her opinion, could alone be called taste.',\n",
       "  'Yet, though smiling within herself at the mistake, she honoured her sister for that blind partiality to Edward which produced it.',\n",
       "  '\"I hope, Marianne,\" continued Elinor, \"you do not consider him as deficient in general taste.  Indeed, I think I may say that you cannot, for your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial, and if THAT were your opinion, I am sure you could never be civil to him.\"',\n",
       "  'Marianne hardly knew what to say.  She would not wound the feelings of her sister on any account, and yet to say what she did not believe was impossible.',\n",
       "  'At length she replied:',\n",
       "  '\"Do not be offended, Elinor, if my praise of him is not in every thing equal to your sense of his merits.  I have not had so many opportunities of estimating the minuter propensities of his mind, his inclinations and tastes, as you have; but I have the highest opinion in the world of his goodness and sense.  I think him every thing that is worthy and amiable.\"',\n",
       "  '\"I am sure,\" replied Elinor, with a smile, \"that his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that.  I do not perceive how you could express yourself more warmly.\"',\n",
       "  'Marianne was rejoiced to find her sister so easily pleased.',\n",
       "  '\"Of his sense and his goodness,\" continued Elinor, \"no one can, I think, be in doubt, who has seen him often enough to engage him in unreserved conversation.  The excellence of his understanding and his principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps him silent.  You know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth. But of his minuter propensities, as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself.  He and I have been at times thrown a good deal together, while you have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother.  I have seen a great deal of him, have studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on subjects of literature and taste; and, upon the whole, I venture to pronounce that his mind is well-informed, enjoyment of books exceedingly great, his imagination lively, his observation just and correct, and his taste delicate and pure.  His abilities in every respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person. At first sight, his address is certainly not striking; and his person can hardly be called handsome, till the expression of his eyes, which are uncommonly good, and the general sweetness of his countenance, is perceived.  At present, I know him so well, that I think him really handsome; or at least, almost so.  What say you, Marianne?\"',\n",
       "  '\"I shall very soon think him handsome, Elinor, if I do not now.  When you tell me to love him as a brother, I shall no more see imperfection in his face, than I now do in his heart.\"',\n",
       "  'Elinor started at this declaration, and was sorry for the warmth she had been betrayed into, in speaking of him.',\n",
       "  \"She felt that Edward stood very high in her opinion.  She believed the regard to be mutual; but she required greater certainty of it to make Marianne's conviction of their attachment agreeable to her.\",\n",
       "  'She knew that what Marianne and her mother conjectured one moment, they believed the next--that with them, to wish was to hope, and to hope was to expect.',\n",
       "  'She tried to explain the real state of the case to her sister.',\n",
       "  '\"I do not attempt to deny,\" said she, \"that I think very highly of him--that I greatly esteem, that I like him.\"',\n",
       "  'Marianne here burst forth with indignation--',\n",
       "  '\"Esteem him! Like him! Cold-hearted Elinor! Oh!  worse than cold-hearted! Ashamed of being otherwise.  Use those words again, and I will leave the room this moment.\"',\n",
       "  'Elinor could not help laughing.',\n",
       "  '\"Excuse me,\" said she; \"and be assured that I meant no offence to you, by speaking, in so quiet a way, of my own feelings.  Believe them to be stronger than I have declared; believe them, in short, to be such as his merit, and the suspicion--the hope of his affection for me may warrant, without imprudence or folly. But farther than this you must not believe.  I am by no means assured of his regard for me.  There are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful; and till his sentiments are fully known, you cannot wonder at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality, by believing or calling it more than it is.  In my heart I feel little--scarcely any doubt of his preference.  But there are other points to be considered besides his inclination.  He is very far from being independent.  What his mother really is we cannot know; but, from Fanny\\'s occasional mention of her conduct and opinions, we have never been disposed to think her amiable; and I am very much mistaken if Edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in his way, if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or high rank.\"',\n",
       "  'Marianne was astonished to find how much the imagination of her mother and herself had outstripped the truth.',\n",
       "  '\"And you really are not engaged to him!\" said she.',\n",
       "  '\"Yet it certainly soon will happen.  But two advantages will proceed from this delay.  I shall not lose you so soon, and Edward will have greater opportunity of improving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must be so indispensably necessary to your future felicity.  Oh! if he should be so far stimulated by your genius as to learn to draw himself, how delightful it would be!\"',\n",
       "  'Elinor had given her real opinion to her sister.  She could not consider her partiality for Edward in so prosperous a state as Marianne had believed it.',\n",
       "  'There was, at times, a want of spirits about him which, if it did not denote indifference, spoke of something almost as unpromising.',\n",
       "  'A doubt of her regard, supposing him to feel it, need not give him more than inquietude.  It would not be likely to produce that dejection of mind which frequently attended him.',\n",
       "  'A more reasonable cause might be found in the dependent situation which forbade the indulgence of his affection.',\n",
       "  'She knew that his mother neither behaved to him so as to make his home comfortable at present, nor to give him any assurance that he might form a home for himself, without strictly attending to her views for his aggrandizement.',\n",
       "  'With such a knowledge as this, it was impossible for Elinor to feel easy on the subject.  She was far from depending on that result of his preference of her, which her mother and sister still considered as certain.',\n",
       "  'Nay, the longer they were together the more doubtful seemed the nature of his regard; and sometimes, for a few painful minutes, she believed it to be no more than friendship.',\n",
       "  'But, whatever might really be its limits, it was enough, when perceived by his sister, to make her uneasy, and at the same time, (which was still more common,) to make her uncivil.',\n",
       "  \"She took the first opportunity of affronting her mother-in-law on the occasion, talking to her so expressively of her brother's great expectations, of Mrs. Ferrars's resolution that both her sons should marry well, and of the danger attending any young woman who attempted to DRAW HIM IN; that Mrs. Dashwood could neither pretend to be unconscious, nor endeavor to be calm.\",\n",
       "  'She gave her an answer which marked her contempt, and instantly left the room, resolving that, whatever might be the inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal, her beloved Elinor should not be exposed another week to such insinuations.',\n",
       "  'In this state of her spirits, a letter was delivered to her from the post, which contained a proposal particularly well timed.',\n",
       "  'It was the offer of a small house, on very easy terms, belonging to a relation of her own, a gentleman of consequence and property in Devonshire.',\n",
       "  'The letter was from this gentleman himself, and written in the true spirit of friendly accommodation.',\n",
       "  'He understood that she was in need of a dwelling; and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage, he assured her that everything should be done to it which she might think necessary, if the situation pleased her.',\n",
       "  'He earnestly pressed her, after giving the particulars of the house and garden, to come with her daughters to Barton Park, the place of his own residence, from whence she might judge, herself, whether Barton Cottage, for the houses were in the same parish, could, by any alteration, be made comfortable to her.',\n",
       "  'He seemed really anxious to accommodate them and the whole of his letter was written in so friendly a style as could not fail of giving pleasure to his cousin; more especially at a moment when she was suffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her nearer connections.',\n",
       "  'She needed no time for deliberation or inquiry.',\n",
       "  'Her resolution was formed as she read.',\n",
       "  'The situation of Barton, in a county so far distant from Sussex as Devonshire, which, but a few hours before, would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every possible advantage belonging to the place, was now its first recommendation.',\n",
       "  \"To quit the neighbourhood of Norland was no longer an evil; it was an object of desire; it was a blessing, in comparison of the misery of continuing her daughter-in-law's guest; and to remove for ever from that beloved place would be less painful than to inhabit or visit it while such a woman was its mistress.\",\n",
       "  'She instantly wrote Sir John Middleton her acknowledgment of his kindness, and her acceptance of his proposal; and then hastened to shew both letters to her daughters, that she might be secure of their approbation before her answer were sent.',\n",
       "  'Elinor had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settle at some distance from Norland, than immediately amongst their present acquaintance.',\n",
       "  \"On THAT head, therefore, it was not for her to oppose her mother's intention of removing into Devonshire.\",\n",
       "  'The house, too, as described by Sir John, was on so simple a scale, and the rent so uncommonly moderate, as to leave her no right of objection on either point; and, therefore, though it was not a plan which brought any charm to her fancy, though it was a removal from the vicinity of Norland beyond her wishes, she made no attempt to dissuade her mother from sending a letter of acquiescence.',\n",
       "  'No sooner was her answer dispatched, than Mrs. Dashwood indulged herself in the pleasure of announcing to her son-in-law and his wife that she was provided with a house, and should incommode them no longer than till every thing were ready for her inhabiting it.',\n",
       "  'They heard her with surprise.',\n",
       "  'Mrs. John Dashwood said nothing; but her husband civilly hoped that she would not be settled far from Norland. She had great satisfaction in replying that she was going into Devonshire.--Edward turned hastily towards her, on hearing this, and, in a voice of surprise and concern, which required no explanation to her, repeated, \"Devonshire! Are you, indeed, going there? So far from hence! And to what part of it?\"',\n",
       "  'She explained the situation.',\n",
       "  'It was within four miles northward of Exeter.',\n",
       "  '\"It is but a cottage,\" she continued, \"but I hope to see many of my friends in it.  A room or two can easily be added; and if my friends find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me, I am sure I will find none in accommodating them.\"',\n",
       "  'She concluded with a very kind invitation to Mr. and Mrs. John Dashwood to visit her at Barton; and to Edward she gave one with still greater affection.',\n",
       "  'Though her late conversation with her daughter-in-law had made her resolve on remaining at Norland no longer than was unavoidable, it had not produced the smallest effect on her in that point to which it principally tended.',\n",
       "  'To separate Edward and Elinor was as far from being her object as ever; and she wished to show Mrs. John Dashwood, by this pointed invitation to her brother, how totally she disregarded her disapprobation of the match.',\n",
       "  'Mr. John Dashwood told his mother again and again how exceedingly sorry he was that she had taken a house at such a distance from Norland as to prevent his being of any service to her in removing her furniture.',\n",
       "  'He really felt conscientiously vexed on the occasion; for the very exertion to which he had limited the performance of his promise to his father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable.--',\n",
       "  \"The furniture was all sent around by water.  It chiefly consisted of household linen, plate, china, and books, with a handsome pianoforte of Marianne's.\",\n",
       "  \"Mrs. John Dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh: she could not help feeling it hard that as Mrs. Dashwood's income would be so trifling in comparison with their own, she should have any handsome article of furniture.\",\n",
       "  'Mrs. Dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth; it was ready furnished, and she might have immediate possession.',\n",
       "  'No difficulty arose on either side in the agreement; and she waited only for the disposal of her effects at Norland, and to determine her future household, before she set off for the west; and this, as she was exceedingly rapid in the performance of everything that interested her, was soon done.--The horses which were left her by her husband had been sold soon after his death, and an opportunity now offering of disposing of her carriage, she agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her eldest daughter.  For the comfort of her children, had she consulted only her own wishes, she would have kept it; but the discretion of Elinor prevailed.  HER wisdom too limited the number of their servants to three; two maids and a man, with whom they were speedily provided from amongst those who had formed their establishment at Norland.',\n",
       "  \"The man and one of the maids were sent off immediately into Devonshire, to prepare the house for their mistress's arrival; for as Lady Middleton was entirely unknown to Mrs. Dashwood, she preferred going directly to the cottage to being a visitor at Barton Park; and she relied so undoubtingly on Sir John's description of the house, as to feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as her own.\",\n",
       "  'Her eagerness to be gone from Norland was preserved from diminution by the evident satisfaction of her daughter-in-law in the prospect of her removal; a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed under a cold invitation to her to defer her departure.',\n",
       "  \"Now was the time when her son-in-law's promise to his father might with particular propriety be fulfilled.  Since he had neglected to do it on first coming to the estate, their quitting his house might be looked on as the most suitable period for its accomplishment.\",\n",
       "  'But Mrs. Dashwood began shortly to give over every hope of the kind, and to be convinced, from the general drift of his discourse, that his assistance extended no farther than their maintenance for six months at Norland.',\n",
       "  'He so frequently talked of the increasing expenses of housekeeping, and of the perpetual demands upon his purse, which a man of any consequence in the world was beyond calculation exposed to, that he seemed rather to stand in need of more money himself than to have any design of giving money away.',\n",
       "  \"In a very few weeks from the day which brought Sir John Middleton's first letter to Norland, every thing was so far settled in their future abode as to enable Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters to begin their journey.\",\n",
       "  'Many were the tears shed by them in their last adieus to a place so much beloved.',\n",
       "  '\"Dear, dear Norland!\" said Marianne, as she wandered alone before the house, on the last evening of their being there; \"when shall I cease to regret you!--when learn to feel a home elsewhere!--Oh! happy house, could you know what I suffer in now viewing you from this spot, from whence perhaps I may view you no more!--And you, ye well-known trees!--but you will continue the same.--No leaf will decay because we are removed, nor any branch become motionless although we can observe you no longer!--No; you will continue the same; unconscious of the pleasure or the regret you occasion, and insensible of any change in those who walk under your shade!--But who will remain to enjoy you?\"',\n",
       "  'The first part of their journey was performed in too melancholy a disposition to be otherwise than tedious and unpleasant.',\n",
       "  'But as they drew towards the end of it, their interest in the appearance of a country which they were to inhabit overcame their dejection, and a view of Barton Valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness.',\n",
       "  'It was a pleasant fertile spot, well wooded, and rich in pasture.',\n",
       "  'After winding along it for more than a mile, they reached their own house.',\n",
       "  'A small green court was the whole of its demesne in front; and a neat wicket gate admitted them into it.',\n",
       "  'As a house, Barton Cottage, though small, was comfortable and compact; but as a cottage it was defective, for the building was regular, the roof was tiled, the window shutters were not painted green, nor were the walls covered with honeysuckles.',\n",
       "  'A narrow passage led directly through the house into the garden behind.',\n",
       "  'On each side of the entrance was a sitting room, about sixteen feet square; and beyond them were the offices and the stairs.',\n",
       "  'Four bed-rooms and two garrets formed the rest of the house.',\n",
       "  'It had not been built many years and was in good repair.',\n",
       "  'In comparison of Norland, it was poor and small indeed!--but the tears which recollection called forth as they entered the house were soon dried away.',\n",
       "  'They were cheered by the joy of the servants on their arrival, and each for the sake of the others resolved to appear happy.',\n",
       "  'It was very early in September; the season was fine, and from first seeing the place under the advantage of good weather, they received an impression in its favour which was of material service in recommending it to their lasting approbation.',\n",
       "  'The situation of the house was good.  High hills rose immediately behind, and at no great distance on each side; some of which were open downs, the others cultivated and woody.',\n",
       "  'The village of Barton was chiefly on one of these hills, and formed a pleasant view from the cottage windows.',\n",
       "  'The prospect in front was more extensive; it commanded the whole of the valley, and reached into the country beyond.',\n",
       "  'The hills which surrounded the cottage terminated the valley in that direction; under another name, and in another course, it branched out again between two of the steepest of them.',\n",
       "  'With the size and furniture of the house Mrs. Dashwood was upon the whole well satisfied; for though her former style of life rendered many additions to the latter indispensable, yet to add and improve was a delight to her; and she had at this time ready money enough to supply all that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments.',\n",
       "  '\"As for the house itself, to be sure,\" said she, \"it is too small for our family, but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present, as it is too late in the year for improvements.  Perhaps in the spring, if I have plenty of money, as I dare say I shall, we may think about building.  These parlors are both too small for such parties of our friends as I hope to see often collected here; and I have some thoughts of throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other, and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance; this, with a new drawing room which may be easily added, and a bed-chamber and garret above, will make it a very snug little cottage.',\n",
       "  'I could wish the stairs were handsome.  But one must not expect every thing; though I suppose it would be no difficult matter to widen them.  I shall see how much I am before-hand with the world in the spring, and we will plan our improvements accordingly.\"',\n",
       "  'In the mean time, till all these alterations could be made from the savings of an income of five hundred a-year by a woman who never saved in her life, they were wise enough to be contented with the house as it was; and each of them was busy in arranging their particular concerns, and endeavoring, by placing around them books and other possessions, to form themselves a home.',\n",
       "  \"Marianne's pianoforte was unpacked and properly disposed of; and Elinor's drawings were affixed to the walls of their sitting room.\",\n",
       "  'In such employments as these they were interrupted soon after breakfast the next day by the entrance of their landlord, who called to welcome them to Barton, and to offer them every accommodation from his own house and garden in which theirs might at present be deficient.',\n",
       "  'Sir John Middleton was a good looking man about forty.  He had formerly visited at Stanhill, but it was too long for his young cousins to remember him.',\n",
       "  'His countenance was thoroughly good-humoured; and his manners were as friendly as the style of his letter.',\n",
       "  'Their arrival seemed to afford him real satisfaction, and their comfort to be an object of real solicitude to him.',\n",
       "  'He said much of his earnest desire of their living in the most sociable terms with his family, and pressed them so cordially to dine at Barton Park every day till they were better settled at home, that, though his entreaties were carried to a point of perseverance beyond civility, they could not give offence.',\n",
       "  'His kindness was not confined to words; for within an hour after he left them, a large basket full of garden stuff and fruit arrived from the park, which was followed before the end of the day by a present of game.',\n",
       "  'He insisted, moreover, on conveying all their letters to and from the post for them, and would not be denied the satisfaction of sending them his newspaper every day.',\n",
       "  'Lady Middleton had sent a very civil message by him, denoting her intention of waiting on Mrs. Dashwood as soon as she could be assured that her visit would be no inconvenience; and as this message was answered by an invitation equally polite, her ladyship was introduced to them the next day.',\n",
       "  'They were, of course, very anxious to see a person on whom so much of their comfort at Barton must depend; and the elegance of her appearance was favourable to their wishes.',\n",
       "  \"Lady Middleton was not more than six or seven and twenty; her face was handsome, her figure tall and striking, and her address graceful.  Her manners had all the elegance which her husband's wanted.\",\n",
       "  'But they would have been improved by some share of his frankness and warmth; and her visit was long enough to detract something from their first admiration, by shewing that, though perfectly well-bred, she was reserved, cold, and had nothing to say for herself beyond the most common-place inquiry or remark.',\n",
       "  'Conversation however was not wanted, for Sir John was very chatty, and Lady Middleton had taken the wise precaution of bringing with her their eldest child, a fine little boy about six years old, by which means there was one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case of extremity, for they had to enquire his name and age, admire his beauty, and ask him questions which his mother answered for him, while he hung about her and held down his head, to the great surprise of her ladyship, who wondered at his being so shy before company, as he could make noise enough at home.',\n",
       "  'On every formal visit a child ought to be of the party, by way of provision for discourse.',\n",
       "  'In the present case it took up ten minutes to determine whether the boy were most like his father or mother, and in what particular he resembled either, for of course every body differed, and every body was astonished at the opinion of the others.',\n",
       "  'An opportunity was soon to be given to the Dashwoods of debating on the rest of the children, as Sir John would not leave the house without securing their promise of dining at the park the next day.',\n",
       "  'Barton Park was about half a mile from the cottage.',\n",
       "  'The ladies had passed near it in their way along the valley, but it was screened from their view at home by the projection of a hill.',\n",
       "  'The house was large and handsome; and the Middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality and elegance.',\n",
       "  \"The former was for Sir John's gratification, the latter for that of his lady.\",\n",
       "  'They were scarcely ever without some friends staying with them in the house, and they kept more company of every kind than any other family in the neighbourhood.',\n",
       "  'It was necessary to the happiness of both; for however dissimilar in temper and outward behaviour, they strongly resembled each other in that total want of talent and taste which confined their employments, unconnected with such as society produced, within a very narrow compass.',\n",
       "  'Sir John was a sportsman, Lady Middleton a mother.  He hunted and shot, and she humoured her children; and these were their only resources.',\n",
       "  \"Lady Middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all the year round, while Sir John's independent employments were in existence only half the time.\",\n",
       "  'Continual engagements at home and abroad, however, supplied all the deficiencies of nature and education; supported the good spirits of Sir John, and gave exercise to the good breeding of his wife.',\n",
       "  'Lady Middleton piqued herself upon the elegance of her table, and of all her domestic arrangements; and from this kind of vanity was her greatest enjoyment in any of their parties.',\n",
       "  \"But Sir John's satisfaction in society was much more real; he delighted in collecting about him more young people than his house would hold, and the noisier they were the better was he pleased.\",\n",
       "  'He was a blessing to all the juvenile part of the neighbourhood, for in summer he was for ever forming parties to eat cold ham and chicken out of doors, and in winter his private balls were numerous enough for any young lady who was not suffering under the unsatiable appetite of fifteen.',\n",
       "  'The arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joy to him, and in every point of view he was charmed with the inhabitants he had now procured for his cottage at Barton.',\n",
       "  'The Miss Dashwoods were young, pretty, and unaffected.  It was enough to secure his good opinion; for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could want to make her mind as captivating as her person.',\n",
       "  'The friendliness of his disposition made him happy in accommodating those, whose situation might be considered, in comparison with the past, as unfortunate.',\n",
       "  'In showing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction of a good heart; and in settling a family of females only in his cottage, he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman; for a sportsman, though he esteems only those of his sex who are sportsmen likewise, is not often desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to a residence within his own manor.',\n",
       "  'Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters were met at the door of the house by Sir John, who welcomed them to Barton Park with unaffected sincerity; and as he attended them to the drawing room repeated to the young ladies the concern which the same subject had drawn from him the day before, at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them.',\n",
       "  'They would see, he said, only one gentleman there besides himself; a particular friend who was staying at the park, but who was neither very young nor very gay.',\n",
       "  'He hoped they would all excuse the smallness of the party, and could assure them it should never happen so again.',\n",
       "  'He had been to several families that morning in hopes of procuring some addition to their number, but it was moonlight and every body was full of engagements.',\n",
       "  \"Luckily Lady Middleton's mother had arrived at Barton within the last hour, and as she was a very cheerful agreeable woman, he hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as they might imagine.\",\n",
       "  'The young ladies, as well as their mother, were perfectly satisfied with having two entire strangers of the party, and wished for no more.',\n",
       "  \"Mrs. Jennings, Lady Middleton's mother, was a good-humoured, merry, fat, elderly woman, who talked a great deal, seemed very happy, and rather vulgar.\",\n",
       "  'She was full of jokes and laughter, and before dinner was over had said many witty things on the subject of lovers and husbands; hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in Sussex, and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not.',\n",
       "  \"Marianne was vexed at it for her sister's sake, and turned her eyes towards Elinor to see how she bore these attacks, with an earnestness which gave Elinor far more pain than could arise from such common-place raillery as Mrs. Jennings's.\",\n",
       "  \"Colonel Brandon, the friend of Sir John, seemed no more adapted by resemblance of manner to be his friend, than Lady Middleton was to be his wife, or Mrs. Jennings to be Lady Middleton's mother.\",\n",
       "  'He was silent and grave.',\n",
       "  'His appearance however was not unpleasing, in spite of his being in the opinion of Marianne and Margaret an absolute old bachelor, for he was on the wrong side of five and thirty; but though his face was not handsome, his countenance was sensible, and his address was particularly gentlemanlike.',\n",
       "  'There was nothing in any of the party which could recommend them as companions to the Dashwoods; but the cold insipidity of Lady Middleton was so particularly repulsive, that in comparison of it the gravity of Colonel Brandon, and even the boisterous mirth of Sir John and his mother-in-law was interesting.',\n",
       "  'Lady Middleton seemed to be roused to enjoyment only by the entrance of her four noisy children after dinner, who pulled her about, tore her clothes, and put an end to every kind of discourse except what related to themselves.',\n",
       "  \"In the evening, as Marianne was discovered to be musical, she was invited to play.  The instrument was unlocked, every body prepared to be charmed, and Marianne, who sang very well, at their request went through the chief of the songs which Lady Middleton had brought into the family on her marriage, and which perhaps had lain ever since in the same position on the pianoforte, for her ladyship had celebrated that event by giving up music, although by her mother's account, she had played extremely well, and by her own was very fond of it.\",\n",
       "  \"Marianne's performance was highly applauded.\",\n",
       "  'Sir John was loud in his admiration at the end of every song, and as loud in his conversation with the others while every song lasted.',\n",
       "  \"Lady Middleton frequently called him to order, wondered how any one's attention could be diverted from music for a moment, and asked Marianne to sing a particular song which Marianne had just finished.\",\n",
       "  'Colonel Brandon alone, of all the party, heard her without being in raptures.  He paid her only the compliment of attention; and she felt a respect for him on the occasion, which the others had reasonably forfeited by their shameless want of taste.',\n",
       "  \"His pleasure in music, though it amounted not to that ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own, was estimable when contrasted against the horrible insensibility of the others; and she was reasonable enough to allow that a man of five and thirty might well have outlived all acuteness of feeling and every exquisite power of enjoyment.  She was perfectly disposed to make every allowance for the colonel's advanced state of life which humanity required.\",\n",
       "  'Mrs. Jennings was a widow with an ample jointure.  She had only two daughters, both of whom she had lived to see respectably married, and she had now therefore nothing to do but to marry all the rest of the world.',\n",
       "  'In the promotion of this object she was zealously active, as far as her ability reached; and missed no opportunity of projecting weddings among all the young people of her acquaintance.',\n",
       "  'She was remarkably quick in the discovery of attachments, and had enjoyed the advantage of raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young lady by insinuations of her power over such a young man; and this kind of discernment enabled her soon after her arrival at Barton decisively to pronounce that Colonel Brandon was very much in love with Marianne Dashwood.',\n",
       "  \"She rather suspected it to be so, on the very first evening of their being together, from his listening so attentively while she sang to them; and when the visit was returned by the Middletons' dining at the cottage, the fact was ascertained by his listening to her again.\",\n",
       "  'It must be so.',\n",
       "  'She was perfectly convinced of it.',\n",
       "  'It would be an excellent match, for HE was rich, and SHE was handsome.',\n",
       "  'Mrs. Jennings had been anxious to see Colonel Brandon well married, ever since her connection with Sir John first brought him to her knowledge; and she was always anxious to get a good husband for every pretty girl.',\n",
       "  'The immediate advantage to herself was by no means inconsiderable, for it supplied her with endless jokes against them both.',\n",
       "  'At the park she laughed at the colonel, and in the cottage at Marianne.',\n",
       "  \"To the former her raillery was probably, as far as it regarded only himself, perfectly indifferent; but to the latter it was at first incomprehensible; and when its object was understood, she hardly knew whether most to laugh at its absurdity, or censure its impertinence, for she considered it as an unfeeling reflection on the colonel's advanced years, and on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor.\",\n",
       "  'Mrs. Dashwood, who could not think a man five years younger than herself, so exceedingly ancient as he appeared to the youthful fancy of her daughter, ventured to clear Mrs. Jennings from the probability of wishing to throw ridicule on his age.',\n",
       "  '\"But at least, Mama, you cannot deny the absurdity of the accusation, though you may not think it intentionally ill-natured.  Colonel Brandon is certainly younger than Mrs. Jennings, but he is old enough to be MY father; and if he were ever animated enough to be in love, must have long outlived every sensation of the kind.  It is too ridiculous!  When is a man to be safe from such wit, if age and infirmity will not protect him?\"',\n",
       "  '\"Infirmity!\" said Elinor, \"do you call Colonel Brandon infirm?  I can easily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my mother; but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs!\"',\n",
       "  '\"Did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism?  and is not that the commonest infirmity of declining life?\"',\n",
       "  '\"My dearest child,\" said her mother, laughing, \"at this rate you must be in continual terror of MY decay; and it must seem to you a miracle that my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Mama, you are not doing me justice.  I know very well that Colonel Brandon is not old enough to make his friends yet apprehensive of losing him in the course of nature.  He may live twenty years longer. But thirty-five has nothing to do with matrimony.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Perhaps,\" said Elinor, \"thirty-five and seventeen had better not have any thing to do with matrimony together.  But if there should by any chance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty, I should not think Colonel Brandon\\'s being thirty-five any objection to his marrying HER.\"',\n",
       "  '\"A woman of seven and twenty,\" said Marianne, after pausing a moment, \"can never hope to feel or inspire affection again, and if her home be uncomfortable, or her fortune small, I can suppose that she might bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse, for the sake of the provision and security of a wife.  In his marrying such a woman therefore there would be nothing unsuitable.  It would be a compact of convenience, and the world would be satisfied.  In my eyes it would be no marriage at all, but that would be nothing.  To me it would seem only a commercial exchange, in which each wished to be benefited at the expense of the other.\"',\n",
       "  '\"It would be impossible, I know,\" replied Elinor, \"to convince you that a woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirty-five anything near enough to love, to make him a desirable companion to her. But I must object to your dooming Colonel Brandon and his wife to the constant confinement of a sick chamber, merely because he chanced to complain yesterday (a very cold damp day) of a slight rheumatic feel in one of his shoulders.\"',\n",
       "  '\"But he talked of flannel waistcoats,\" said Marianne; \"and with me a flannel waistcoat is invariably connected with aches, cramps, rheumatisms, and every species of ailment that can afflict the old and the feeble.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Had he been only in a violent fever, you would not have despised him half so much.  Confess, Marianne, is not there something interesting to you in the flushed cheek, hollow eye, and quick pulse of a fever?\"',\n",
       "  \"Soon after this, upon Elinor's leaving the room,\",\n",
       "  '\"Mama,\" said Marianne, \"I have an alarm on the subject of illness which I cannot conceal from you.  I am sure Edward Ferrars is not well.  We have now been here almost a fortnight, and yet he does not come.  Nothing but real indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay.  What else can detain him at Norland?\"',\n",
       "  '\"Had you any idea of his coming so soon?\" said Mrs. Dashwood.',\n",
       "  '\"I had none.  On the contrary, if I have felt any anxiety at all on the subject, it has been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want of pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation, when I talked of his coming to Barton.  Does Elinor expect him already?\"',\n",
       "  '\"I have never mentioned it to her, but of course she must.\"',\n",
       "  '\"I rather think you are mistaken, for when I was talking to her yesterday of getting a new grate for the spare bedchamber, she observed that there was no immediate hurry for it, as it was not likely that the room would be wanted for some time.\"',\n",
       "  '\"How strange this is! what can be the meaning of it!  But the whole of their behaviour to each other has been unaccountable! How cold, how composed were their last adieus! How languid their conversation the last evening of their being together!',\n",
       "  \"In Edward's farewell there was no distinction between Elinor and me: it was the good wishes of an affectionate brother to both.  Twice did I leave them purposely together in the course of the last morning, and each time did he most unaccountably follow me out of the room.\",\n",
       "  'And Elinor, in quitting Norland and Edward, cried not as I did.',\n",
       "  'Even now her self-command is invariable.  When is she dejected or melancholy? When does she try to avoid society, or appear restless and dissatisfied in it?\"',\n",
       "  'The Dashwoods were now settled at Barton with tolerable comfort to themselves.',\n",
       "  'The house and the garden, with all the objects surrounding them, were now become familiar, and the ordinary pursuits which had given to Norland half its charms were engaged in again with far greater enjoyment than Norland had been able to afford, since the loss of their father.',\n",
       "  'Sir John Middleton, who called on them every day for the first fortnight, and who was not in the habit of seeing much occupation at home, could not conceal his amazement on finding them always employed.',\n",
       "  \"Their visitors, except those from Barton Park, were not many; for, in spite of Sir John's urgent entreaties that they would mix more in the neighbourhood, and repeated assurances of his carriage being always at their service, the independence of Mrs. Dashwood's spirit overcame the wish of society for her children; and she was resolute in declining to visit any family beyond the distance of a walk.\",\n",
       "  'There were but few who could be so classed; and it was not all of them that were attainable.',\n",
       "  'About a mile and a half from the cottage, along the narrow winding valley of Allenham, which issued from that of Barton, as formerly described, the girls had, in one of their earliest walks, discovered an ancient respectable looking mansion which, by reminding them a little of Norland, interested their imagination and made them wish to be better acquainted with it.',\n",
       "  'But they learnt, on enquiry, that its possessor, an elderly lady of very good character, was unfortunately too infirm to mix with the world, and never stirred from home.',\n",
       "  'The whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks.',\n",
       "  'The high downs which invited them from almost every window of the cottage to seek the exquisite enjoyment of air on their summits, were a happy alternative when the dirt of the valleys beneath shut up their superior beauties; and towards one of these hills did Marianne and Margaret one memorable morning direct their steps, attracted by the partial sunshine of a showery sky, and unable longer to bear the confinement which the settled rain of the two preceding days had occasioned.',\n",
       "  \"The weather was not tempting enough to draw the two others from their pencil and their book, in spite of Marianne's declaration that the day would be lastingly fair, and that every threatening cloud would be drawn off from their hills; and the two girls set off together.\",\n",
       "  'They gaily ascended the downs, rejoicing in their own penetration at every glimpse of blue sky; and when they caught in their faces the animating gales of a high south-westerly wind, they pitied the fears which had prevented their mother and Elinor from sharing such delightful sensations.',\n",
       "  '\"Is there a felicity in the world,\" said Marianne, \"superior to this?--Margaret, we will walk here at least two hours.\"',\n",
       "  'Margaret agreed, and they pursued their way against the wind, resisting it with laughing delight for about twenty minutes longer, when suddenly the clouds united over their heads, and a driving rain set full in their face.--',\n",
       "  'Chagrined and surprised, they were obliged, though unwillingly, to turn back, for no shelter was nearer than their own house.',\n",
       "  'One consolation however remained for them, to which the exigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety; it was that of running with all possible speed down the steep side of the hill which led immediately to their garden gate.',\n",
       "  'They set off.',\n",
       "  'Marianne had at first the advantage, but a false step brought her suddenly to the ground; and Margaret, unable to stop herself to assist her, was involuntarily hurried along, and reached the bottom in safety.',\n",
       "  'A gentleman carrying a gun, with two pointers playing round him, was passing up the hill and within a few yards of Marianne, when her accident happened.',\n",
       "  'He put down his gun and ran to her assistance.',\n",
       "  'She had raised herself from the ground, but her foot had been twisted in her fall, and she was scarcely able to stand.',\n",
       "  'The gentleman offered his services; and perceiving that her modesty declined what her situation rendered necessary, took her up in his arms without farther delay, and carried her down the hill.',\n",
       "  'Then passing through the garden, the gate of which had been left open by Margaret, he bore her directly into the house, whither Margaret was just arrived, and quitted not his hold till he had seated her in a chair in the parlour.',\n",
       "  'Elinor and her mother rose up in amazement at their entrance, and while the eyes of both were fixed on him with an evident wonder and a secret admiration which equally sprung from his appearance, he apologized for his intrusion by relating its cause, in a manner so frank and so graceful that his person, which was uncommonly handsome, received additional charms from his voice and expression.',\n",
       "  'Had he been even old, ugly, and vulgar, the gratitude and kindness of Mrs. Dashwood would have been secured by any act of attention to her child; but the influence of youth, beauty, and elegance, gave an interest to the action which came home to her feelings.',\n",
       "  'She thanked him again and again; and, with a sweetness of address which always attended her, invited him to be seated.',\n",
       "  'But this he declined, as he was dirty and wet.',\n",
       "  'Mrs. Dashwood then begged to know to whom she was obliged.',\n",
       "  'His name, he replied, was Willoughby, and his present home was at Allenham, from whence he hoped she would allow him the honour of calling tomorrow to enquire after Miss Dashwood.',\n",
       "  'The honour was readily granted, and he then departed, to make himself still more interesting, in the midst of a heavy rain.',\n",
       "  'His manly beauty and more than common gracefulness were instantly the theme of general admiration, and the laugh which his gallantry raised against Marianne received particular spirit from his exterior attractions.--',\n",
       "  'Marianne herself had seen less of his Mama the rest, for the confusion which crimsoned over her face, on his lifting her up, had robbed her of the power of regarding him after their entering the house.',\n",
       "  'But she had seen enough of him to join in all the admiration of the others, and with an energy which always adorned her praise.',\n",
       "  'His person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawn for the hero of a favourite story; and in his carrying her into the house with so little previous formality, there was a rapidity of thought which particularly recommended the action to her.',\n",
       "  'Every circumstance belonging to him was interesting.',\n",
       "  'His name was good, his residence was in their favourite village, and she soon found out that of all manly dresses a shooting-jacket was the most becoming.',\n",
       "  'Her imagination was busy, her reflections were pleasant, and the pain of a sprained ankle was disregarded.',\n",
       "  \"Sir John called on them as soon as the next interval of fair weather that morning allowed him to get out of doors; and Marianne's accident being related to him, he was eagerly asked whether he knew any gentleman of the name of Willoughby at Allenham.\",\n",
       "  '\"Willoughby!\" cried Sir John; \"what, is HE in the country? That is good news however; I will ride over tomorrow, and ask him to dinner on Thursday.\"',\n",
       "  '\"You know him then,\" said Mrs. Dashwood.',\n",
       "  '\"Know him! to be sure I do.  Why, he is down here every year.\"',\n",
       "  '\"And what sort of a young man is he?\"',\n",
       "  '\"As good a kind of fellow as ever lived, I assure you.  A very decent shot, and there is not a bolder rider in England.\"',\n",
       "  '\"And is that all you can say for him?\" cried Marianne, indignantly.',\n",
       "  '\"But what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance? What his pursuits, his talents, and genius?\"',\n",
       "  'Sir John was rather puzzled.',\n",
       "  '\"Upon my soul,\" said he, \"I do not know much about him as to all THAT. But he is a pleasant, good humoured fellow, and has got the nicest little black bitch of a pointer I ever saw.  Was she out with him today?\"',\n",
       "  \"But Marianne could no more satisfy him as to the colour of Mr. Willoughby's pointer, than he could describe to her the shades of his mind.\",\n",
       "  '\"But who is he?\" said Elinor.',\n",
       "  '\"Where does he come from?  Has he a house at Allenham?\"',\n",
       "  'On this point Sir John could give more certain intelligence; and he told them that Mr. Willoughby had no property of his own in the country; that he resided there only while he was visiting the old lady at Allenham Court, to whom he was related, and whose possessions he was to inherit; adding,',\n",
       "  '\"Yes, yes, he is very well worth catching I can tell you, Miss Dashwood; he has a pretty little estate of his own in Somersetshire besides; and if I were you, I would not give him up to my younger sister, in spite of all this tumbling down hills.  Miss Marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself.  Brandon will be jealous, if she does not take care.\"',\n",
       "  '\"I do not believe,\" said Mrs. Dashwood, with a good humoured smile, \"that Mr. Willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of MY daughters towards what you call CATCHING him.  It is not an employment to which they have been brought up.  Men are very safe with us, let them be ever so rich.  I am glad to find, however, from what you say, that he is a respectable young man, and one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible.\"',\n",
       "  '\"He is as good a sort of fellow, I believe, as ever lived,\" repeated Sir John.',\n",
       "  '\"I remember last Christmas at a little hop at the park, he danced from eight o\\'clock till four, without once sitting down.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Did he indeed?\" cried Marianne with sparkling eyes, \"and with elegance, with spirit?\"',\n",
       "  '\"Yes; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert.\"',\n",
       "  '\"That is what I like; that is what a young man ought to be.  Whatever be his pursuits, his eagerness in them should know no moderation, and leave him no sense of fatigue.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Aye, aye, I see how it will be,\" said Sir John, \"I see how it will be. You will be setting your cap at him now, and never think of poor Brandon.\"',\n",
       "  '\"That is an expression, Sir John,\" said Marianne, warmly, \"which I particularly dislike.  I abhor every common-place phrase by which wit is intended; and \\'setting one\\'s cap at a man,\\' or \\'making a conquest,\\' are the most odious of all.  Their tendency is gross and illiberal; and if their construction could ever be deemed clever, time has long ago destroyed all its ingenuity.\"',\n",
       "  'Sir John did not much understand this reproof; but he laughed as heartily as if he did, and then replied,\"Ay, you will make conquests enough, I dare say, one way or other. Poor Brandon! he is quite smitten already, and he is very well worth setting your cap at, I can tell you, in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining of ankles.\"',\n",
       "  \"Marianne's preserver, as Margaret, with more elegance than precision, styled Willoughby, called at the cottage early the next morning to make his personal enquiries.\",\n",
       "  \"He was received by Mrs. Dashwood with more than politeness; with a kindness which Sir John's account of him and her own gratitude prompted; and every thing that passed during the visit tended to assure him of the sense, elegance, mutual affection, and domestic comfort of the family to whom accident had now introduced him.\",\n",
       "  'Of their personal charms he had not required a second interview to be convinced.',\n",
       "  'Miss Dashwood had a delicate complexion, regular features, and a remarkably pretty figure.',\n",
       "  \"Marianne was still handsomer.  Her form, though not so correct as her sister's, in having the advantage of height, was more striking; and her face was so lovely, that when in the common cant of praise, she was called a beautiful girl, truth was less violently outraged than usually happens.\",\n",
       "  'Her skin was very brown, but, from its transparency, her complexion was uncommonly brilliant; her features were all good; her smile was sweet and attractive; and in her eyes, which were very dark, there was a life, a spirit, an eagerness, which could hardily be seen without delight.',\n",
       "  'From Willoughby their expression was at first held back, by the embarrassment which the remembrance of his assistance created.',\n",
       "  'But when this passed away, when her spirits became collected, when she saw that to the perfect good-breeding of the gentleman, he united frankness and vivacity, and above all, when she heard him declare, that of music and dancing he was passionately fond, she gave him such a look of approbation as secured the largest share of his discourse to herself for the rest of his stay.',\n",
       "  'It was only necessary to mention any favourite amusement to engage her to talk.',\n",
       "  'She could not be silent when such points were introduced, and she had neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion.',\n",
       "  'They speedily discovered that their enjoyment of dancing and music was mutual, and that it arose from a general conformity of judgment in all that related to either.',\n",
       "  'Encouraged by this to a further examination of his opinions, she proceeded to question him on the subject of books; her favourite authors were brought forward and dwelt upon with so rapturous a delight, that any young man of five and twenty must have been insensible indeed, not to become an immediate convert to the excellence of such works, however disregarded before.',\n",
       "  'Their taste was strikingly alike.',\n",
       "  'The same books, the same passages were idolized by each--or if any difference appeared, any objection arose, it lasted no longer than till the force of her arguments and the brightness of her eyes could be displayed.',\n",
       "  'He acquiesced in all her decisions, caught all her enthusiasm; and long before his visit concluded, they conversed with the familiarity of a long-established acquaintance.',\n",
       "  '\"Well, Marianne,\" said Elinor, as soon as he had left them, \"for ONE morning I think you have done pretty well.  You have already ascertained Mr. Willoughby\\'s opinion in almost every matter of importance.  You know what he thinks of Cowper and Scott; you are certain of his estimating their beauties as he ought, and you have received every assurance of his admiring Pope no more than is proper. But how is your acquaintance to be long supported, under such extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse?  You will soon have exhausted each favourite topic.  Another meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty, and second marriages, and then you can have nothing farther to ask.\"--',\n",
       "  '\"Elinor,\" cried Marianne, \"is this fair? is this just? are my ideas so scanty?  But I see what you mean.  I have been too much at my ease, too happy, too frank.  I have erred against every common-place notion of decorum; I have been open and sincere where I ought to have been reserved, spiritless, dull, and deceitful--had I talked only of the weather and the roads, and had I spoken only once in ten minutes, this reproach would have been spared.\"',\n",
       "  '\"My love,\" said her mother, \"you must not be offended with Elinor--she was only in jest.  I should scold her myself, if she were capable of wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new friend.\"--',\n",
       "  'Marianne was softened in a moment.',\n",
       "  \"Willoughby, on his side, gave every proof of his pleasure in their acquaintance, which an evident wish of improving it could offer.  He came to them every day.  To enquire after Marianne was at first his excuse; but the encouragement of his reception, to which every day gave greater kindness, made such an excuse unnecessary before it had ceased to be possible, by Marianne's perfect recovery.\",\n",
       "  'She was confined for some days to the house; but never had any confinement been less irksome.',\n",
       "  \"Willoughby was a young man of good abilities, quick imagination, lively spirits, and open, affectionate manners.  He was exactly formed to engage Marianne's heart, for with all this, he joined not only a captivating person, but a natural ardour of mind which was now roused and increased by the example of her own, and which recommended him to her affection beyond every thing else.\",\n",
       "  'His society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment.  They read, they talked, they sang together; his musical talents were considerable; and he read with all the sensibility and spirit which Edward had unfortunately wanted.',\n",
       "  \"In Mrs. Dashwood's estimation he was as faultless as in Marianne's; and Elinor saw nothing to censure in him but a propensity, in which he strongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her sister, of saying too much what he thought on every occasion, without attention to persons or circumstances.\",\n",
       "  'In hastily forming and giving his opinion of other people, in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment of undivided attention where his heart was engaged, and in slighting too easily the forms of worldly propriety, he displayed a want of caution which Elinor could not approve, in spite of all that he and Marianne could say in its support.',\n",
       "  'Marianne began now to perceive that the desperation which had seized her at sixteen and a half, of ever seeing a man who could satisfy her ideas of perfection, had been rash and unjustifiable.',\n",
       "  'Willoughby was all that her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour and in every brighter period, as capable of attaching her; and his behaviour declared his wishes to be in that respect as earnest, as his abilities were strong.',\n",
       "  'Her mother too, in whose mind not one speculative thought of their marriage had been raised, by his prospect of riches, was led before the end of a week to hope and expect it; and secretly to congratulate herself on having gained two such sons-in-law as Edward and Willoughby.',\n",
       "  \"Colonel Brandon's partiality for Marianne, which had so early been discovered by his friends, now first became perceptible to Elinor, when it ceased to be noticed by them.\",\n",
       "  'Their attention and wit were drawn off to his more fortunate rival; and the raillery which the other had incurred before any partiality arose, was removed when his feelings began really to call for the ridicule so justly annexed to sensibility.',\n",
       "  'Elinor was obliged, though unwillingly, to believe that the sentiments which Mrs. Jennings had assigned him for her own satisfaction, were now actually excited by her sister; and that however a general resemblance of disposition between the parties might forward the affection of Mr. Willoughby, an equally striking opposition of character was no hindrance to the regard of Colonel Brandon.',\n",
       "  'She saw it with concern; for what could a silent man of five and thirty hope, when opposed to a very lively one of five and twenty? and as she could not even wish him successful, she heartily wished him indifferent.',\n",
       "  'She liked him--in spite of his gravity and reserve, she beheld in him an object of interest.',\n",
       "  'His manners, though serious, were mild; and his reserve appeared rather the result of some oppression of spirits than of any natural gloominess of temper.',\n",
       "  'Sir John had dropped hints of past injuries and disappointments, which justified her belief of his being an unfortunate man, and she regarded him with respect and compassion.',\n",
       "  'Perhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more because he was slighted by Willoughby and Marianne, who, prejudiced against him for being neither lively nor young, seemed resolved to undervalue his merits.',\n",
       "  '\"Brandon is just the kind of man,\" said Willoughby one day, when they were talking of him together, \"whom every body speaks well of, and nobody cares about; whom all are delighted to see, and nobody remembers to talk to.\"',\n",
       "  '\"That is exactly what I think of him,\" cried Marianne.',\n",
       "  '\"Do not boast of it, however,\" said Elinor, \"for it is injustice in both of you.  He is highly esteemed by all the family at the park, and I never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him.\"',\n",
       "  '\"That he is patronised by YOU,\" replied Willoughby, \"is certainly in his favour; but as for the esteem of the others, it is a reproach in itself.  Who would submit to the indignity of being approved by such a woman as Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings, that could command the indifference of any body else?\"',\n",
       "  '\"But perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and Marianne will make amends for the regard of Lady Middleton and her mother.  If their praise is censure, your censure may be praise, for they are not more undiscerning, than you are prejudiced and unjust.\"',\n",
       "  '\"In defence of your protege you can even be saucy.\"',\n",
       "  '\"My protege, as you call him, is a sensible man; and sense will always have attractions for me.  Yes, Marianne, even in a man between thirty and forty.  He has seen a great deal of the world; has been abroad, has read, and has a thinking mind.  I have found him capable of giving me much information on various subjects; and he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of good-breeding and good nature.\"',\n",
       "  '\"That is to say,\" cried Marianne contemptuously, \"he has told you, that in the East Indies the climate is hot, and the mosquitoes are troublesome.\"',\n",
       "  '\"He WOULD have told me so, I doubt not, had I made any such inquiries, but they happened to be points on which I had been previously informed.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Perhaps,\" said Willoughby, \"his observations may have extended to the existence of nabobs, gold mohrs, and palanquins.\"',\n",
       "  '\"I may venture to say that HIS observations have stretched much further than your candour.  But why should you dislike him?\"',\n",
       "  '\"I do not dislike him.  I consider him, on the contrary, as a very respectable man, who has every body\\'s good word, and nobody\\'s notice; who, has more money than he can spend, more time than he knows how to employ, and two new coats every year.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Add to which,\" cried Marianne, \"that he has neither genius, taste, nor spirit.  That his understanding has no brilliancy, his feelings no ardour, and his voice no expression.\"',\n",
       "  '\"You decide on his imperfections so much in the mass,\" replied Elinor, \"and so much on the strength of your own imagination, that the commendation I am able to give of him is comparatively cold and insipid.  I can only pronounce him to be a sensible man, well-bred, well-informed, of gentle address, and, I believe, possessing an amiable heart.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Miss Dashwood,\" cried Willoughby, \"you are now using me unkindly.  You are endeavouring to disarm me by reason, and to convince me against my will.  But it will not do.  You shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful.  I have three unanswerable reasons for disliking Colonel Brandon; he threatened me with rain when I wanted it to be fine; he has found fault with the hanging of my curricle, and I cannot persuade him to buy my brown mare.  If it will be any satisfaction to you, however, to be told, that I believe his character to be in other respects irreproachable, I am ready to confess it.  And in return for an acknowledgment, which must give me some pain, you cannot deny me the privilege of disliking him as much as ever.\"',\n",
       "  'Little had Mrs. Dashwood or her daughters imagined when they first came into Devonshire, that so many engagements would arise to occupy their time as shortly presented themselves, or that they should have such frequent invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them little leisure for serious employment.',\n",
       "  'Yet such was the case.',\n",
       "  'When Marianne was recovered, the schemes of amusement at home and abroad, which Sir John had been previously forming, were put into execution.',\n",
       "  'The private balls at the park then began; and parties on the water were made and accomplished as often as a showery October would allow.',\n",
       "  'In every meeting of the kind Willoughby was included; and the ease and familiarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly calculated to give increasing intimacy to his acquaintance with the Dashwoods, to afford him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of Marianne, of marking his animated admiration of her, and of receiving, in her behaviour to himself, the most pointed assurance of her affection.',\n",
       "  'Elinor could not be surprised at their attachment.  She only wished that it were less openly shewn; and once or twice did venture to suggest the propriety of some self-command to Marianne.',\n",
       "  'But Marianne abhorred all concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve; and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not in themselves illaudable, appeared to her not merely an unnecessary effort, but a disgraceful subjection of reason to common-place and mistaken notions.',\n",
       "  'Willoughby thought the same; and their behaviour at all times, was an illustration of their opinions.',\n",
       "  'When he was present she had no eyes for any one else.',\n",

       "  'If dancing formed the amusement of the night, they were partners for half the time; and when obliged to separate for a couple of dances, were careful to stand together and scarcely spoke a word to any body else.',\n",
       "  'Such conduct made them of course most exceedingly laughed at; but ridicule could not shame, and seemed hardly to provoke them.',\n",
       "  'Mrs. Dashwood entered into all their feelings with a warmth which left her no inclination for checking this excessive display of them.',\n",

       "  \"Elinor's happiness was not so great.  Her heart was not so much at ease, nor her satisfaction in their amusements so pure.\",\n",
       "  'They afforded her no companion that could make amends for what she had left behind, nor that could teach her to think of Norland with less regret than ever.',\n",
       "  'Neither Lady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could supply to her the conversation she missed; although the latter was an everlasting talker, and from the first had regarded her with a kindness which ensured her a large share of her discourse.',\n",
       "  \"She had already repeated her own history to Elinor three or four times; and had Elinor's memory been equal to her means of improvement, she might have known very early in their acquaintance all the particulars of Mr. Jennings's last illness, and what he said to his wife a few minutes before he died.\",\n",
       "  'Lady Middleton was more agreeable than her mother only in being more silent.',\n",
       "  'Elinor needed little observation to perceive that her reserve was a mere calmness of manner with which sense had nothing to do.',\n",
       "  'Towards her husband and mother she was the same as to them; and intimacy was therefore neither to be looked for nor desired.',\n",
       "  'She had nothing to say one day that she had not said the day before.',\n",
       "  'Her insipidity was invariable, for even her spirits were always the same; and though she did not oppose the parties arranged by her husband, provided every thing were conducted in style and her two eldest children attended her, she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than she might have experienced in sitting at home;--and so little did her presence add to the pleasure of the others, by any share in their conversation, that they were sometimes only reminded of her being amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys.',\n",
       "  'In Colonel Brandon alone, of all her new acquaintance, did Elinor find a person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities, excite the interest of friendship, or give pleasure as a companion.',\n",
       "  \"Willoughby was out of the question.  Her admiration and regard, even her sisterly regard, was all his own; but he was a lover; his attentions were wholly Marianne's, and a far less agreeable man might have been more generally pleasing.\",\n",
       "  'Colonel Brandon, unfortunately for himself, had no such encouragement to think only of Marianne, and in conversing with Elinor he found the greatest consolation for the indifference of her sister.',\n",
       "  \"Elinor's compassion for him increased, as she had reason to suspect that the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him.\",\n",
       "  'This suspicion was given by some words which accidentally dropped from him one evening at the park, when they were sitting down together by mutual consent, while the others were dancing.',\n",
       "  'His eyes were fixed on Marianne, and, after a silence of some minutes, he said, with a faint smile, \"Your sister, I understand, does not approve of second attachments.\"',\n",
       "  '\"No,\" replied Elinor, \"her opinions are all romantic.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Or rather, as I believe, she considers them impossible to exist.\"',\n",
       "  '\"I believe she does.  But how she contrives it without reflecting on the character of her own father, who had himself two wives, I know not. A few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis of common sense and observation; and then they may be more easy to define and to justify than they now are, by any body but herself.\"',\n",
       "  '\"This will probably be the case,\" he replied; \"and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind, that one is sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions.\"',\n",
       "  '\"I cannot agree with you there,\" said Elinor.',\n",
       "  '\"There are inconveniences attending such feelings as Marianne\\'s, which all the charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world cannot atone for.  Her systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought; and a better acquaintance with the world is what I look forward to as her greatest possible advantage.\"',\n",
       "  'After a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying,--',\n",
       "  '\"Does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a second attachment? or is it equally criminal in every body?  Are those who have been disappointed in their first choice, whether from the inconstancy of its object, or the perverseness of circumstances, to be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives?\"',\n",
       "  '\"Upon my word, I am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles. I only know that I never yet heard her admit any instance of a second attachment\\'s being pardonable.\"',\n",
       "  '\"This,\" said he, \"cannot hold; but a change, a total change of sentiments--No, no, do not desire it; for when the romantic refinements of a young mind are obliged to give way, how frequently are they succeeded by such opinions as are but too common, and too dangerous!  I speak from experience.  I once knew a lady who in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister, who thought and judged like her, but who from an inforced change--from a series of unfortunate circumstances\"--',\n",
       "  \"Here he stopt suddenly; appeared to think that he had said too much, and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures, which might not otherwise have entered Elinor's head.  The lady would probably have passed without suspicion, had he not convinced Miss Dashwood that what concerned her ought not to escape his lips.  As it was, it required but a slight effort of fancy to connect his emotion with the tender recollection of past regard.\",\n",
       "  'Elinor attempted no more.',\n",
       "  'But Marianne, in her place, would not have done so little.  The whole story would have been speedily formed under her active imagination; and every thing established in the most melancholy order of disastrous love.',\n",
       "  \"As Elinor and Marianne were walking together the next morning the latter communicated a piece of news to her sister, which in spite of all that she knew before of Marianne's imprudence and want of thought, surprised her by its extravagant testimony of both.\",\n",
       "  'Marianne told her, with the greatest delight, that Willoughby had given her a horse, one that he had bred himself on his estate in Somersetshire, and which was exactly calculated to carry a woman.',\n",
       "  \"Without considering that it was not in her mother's plan to keep any horse, that if she were to alter her resolution in favour of this gift, she must buy another for the servant, and keep a servant to ride it, and after all, build a stable to receive them, she had accepted the present without hesitation, and told her sister of it in raptures.\",\n",
       "  '\"He intends to send his groom into Somersetshire immediately for it,\" she added, \"and when it arrives we will ride every day.  You shall share its use with me.  Imagine to yourself, my dear Elinor, the delight of a gallop on some of these downs.\"',\n",
       "  'Most unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of felicity to comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended the affair; and for some time she refused to submit to them.',\n",
       "  'As to an additional servant, the expense would be a trifle; Mama she was sure would never object to it; and any horse would do for HIM; he might always get one at the park; as to a stable, the merest shed would be sufficient.',\n",
       "  'Elinor then ventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving such a present from a man so little, or at least so lately known to her.',\n",
       "  'This was too much.',\n",
       "  '\"You are mistaken, Elinor,\" said she warmly, \"in supposing I know very little of Willoughby.  I have not known him long indeed, but I am much better acquainted with him, than I am with any other creature in the world, except yourself and mama.  It is not time or opportunity that is to determine intimacy;--it is disposition alone.  Seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other, and seven days are more than enough for others.  I should hold myself guilty of greater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother, than from Willoughby.  Of John I know very little, though we have lived together for years; but of Willoughby my judgment has long been formed.\"',\n",
       "  'Elinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more.',\n",
       "  \"She knew her sister's temper.\",\n",
       "  'Opposition on so tender a subject would only attach her the more to her own opinion.',\n",
       "  'But by an appeal to her affection for her mother, by representing the inconveniences which that indulgent mother must draw on herself, if (as would probably be the case) she consented to this increase of establishment, Marianne was shortly subdued; and she promised not to tempt her mother to such imprudent kindness by mentioning the offer, and to tell Willoughby when she saw him next, that it must be declined.',\n",
       "  'She was faithful to her word; and when Willoughby called at the cottage, the same day, Elinor heard her express her disappointment to him in a low voice, on being obliged to forego the acceptance of his present.',\n",
       "  'The reasons for this alteration were at the same time related, and they were such as to make further entreaty on his side impossible.',\n",
       "  'His concern however was very apparent; and after expressing it with earnestness, he added, in the same low voice,--\"But, Marianne, the horse is still yours, though you cannot use it now.  I shall keep it only till you can claim it.  When you leave Barton to form your own establishment in a more lasting home, Queen Mab shall receive you.\"',\n",
       "  'This was all overheard by Miss Dashwood; and in the whole of the sentence, in his manner of pronouncing it, and in his addressing her sister by her Christian name alone, she instantly saw an intimacy so decided, a meaning so direct, as marked a perfect agreement between them.',\n",
       "  'From that moment she doubted not of their being engaged to each other; and the belief of it created no other surprise than that she, or any of their friends, should be left by tempers so frank, to discover it by accident.',\n",
       "  'Margaret related something to her the next day, which placed this matter in a still clearer light.',\n",
       "  'Willoughby had spent the preceding evening with them, and Margaret, by being left some time in the parlour with only him and Marianne, had had opportunity for observations, which, with a most important face, she communicated to her eldest sister, when they were next by themselves.',\n",
       "  '\"Oh, Elinor!\" she cried, \"I have such a secret to tell you about Marianne.  I am sure she will be married to Mr. Willoughby very soon.\"',\n",
       "  '\"You have said so,\" replied Elinor, \"almost every day since they first met on High-church Down; and they had not known each other a week, I believe, before you were certain that Marianne wore his picture round her neck; but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great uncle.\"',\n",
       "  '\"But indeed this is quite another thing.  I am sure they will be married very soon, for he has got a lock of her hair.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Take care, Margaret.  It may be only the hair of some great uncle of HIS.\"',\n",
       "  '\"But, indeed, Elinor, it is Marianne\\'s. I am almost sure it is, for I saw him cut it off.  Last night after tea, when you and mama went out of the room, they were whispering and talking together as fast as could be, and he seemed to be begging something of her, and presently he took up her scissors and cut off a long lock of her hair, for it was all tumbled down her back; and he kissed it, and folded it up in a piece of white paper; and put it into his pocket-book.\"',\n",
       "  'For such particulars, stated on such authority, Elinor could not withhold her credit; nor was she disposed to it, for the circumstance was in perfect unison with what she had heard and seen herself.',\n",
       "  \"Margaret's sagacity was not always displayed in a way so satisfactory to her sister.\",\n",
       "  'When Mrs. Jennings attacked her one evening at the park, to give the name of the young man who was Elinor\\'s particular favourite, which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her, Margaret answered by looking at her sister, and saying, \"I must not tell, may I, Elinor?\"',\n",
       "  'This of course made every body laugh; and Elinor tried to laugh too.',\n",
       "  'But the effort was painful.  She was convinced that Margaret had fixed on a person whose name she could not bear with composure to become a standing joke with Mrs. Jennings.',\n",
       "  'Marianne felt for her most sincerely; but she did more harm than good to the cause, by turning very red and saying in an angry manner to Margaret,',\n",
       "  '\"Remember that whatever your conjectures may be, you have no right to repeat them.\"',\n",
       "  '\"I never had any conjectures about it,\" replied Margaret; \"it was you who told me of it yourself.\"',\n",
       "  'This increased the mirth of the company, and Margaret was eagerly pressed to say something more.',\n",
       "  '\"Oh! pray, Miss Margaret, let us know all about it,\" said Mrs. Jennings.',\n",
       "  '\"What is the gentleman\\'s name?\"',\n",
       "  '\"I must not tell, ma\\'am. But I know very well what it is; and I know where he is too.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Yes, yes, we can guess where he is; at his own house at Norland to be sure.  He is the curate of the parish I dare say.\"',\n",
       "  '\"No, THAT he is not.  He is of no profession at all.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Margaret,\" said Marianne with great warmth, \"you know that all this is an invention of your own, and that there is no such person in existence.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Well, then, he is lately dead, Marianne, for I am sure there was such a man once, and his name begins with an F.\"',\n",
       "  'Most grateful did Elinor feel to Lady Middleton for observing, at this moment, \"that it rained very hard,\" though she believed the interruption to proceed less from any attention to her, than from her ladyship\\'s great dislike of all such inelegant subjects of raillery as delighted her husband and mother.',\n",
       "  'The idea however started by her, was immediately pursued by Colonel Brandon, who was on every occasion mindful of the feelings of others; and much was said on the subject of rain by both of them.',\n",

       "  'A party was formed this evening for going on the following day to see a very fine place about twelve miles from Barton, belonging to a brother-in-law of Colonel Brandon, without whose interest it could not be seen, as the proprietor, who was then abroad, had left strict orders on that head.',\n",
       "  'The grounds were declared to be highly beautiful, and Sir John, who was particularly warm in their praise, might be allowed to be a tolerable judge, for he had formed parties to visit them, at least, twice every summer for the last ten years.',\n",
       "  \"They contained a noble piece of water; a sail on which was to a form a great part of the morning's amusement; cold provisions were to be taken, open carriages only to be employed, and every thing conducted in the usual style of a complete party of pleasure.\",\n",
       "  'To some few of the company it appeared rather a bold undertaking, considering the time of year, and that it had rained every day for the last fortnight;--and Mrs. Dashwood, who had already a cold, was persuaded by Elinor to stay at home.',\n",
       "  'Their intended excursion to Whitwell turned out very different from what Elinor had expected.  She was prepared to be wet through, fatigued, and frightened; but the event was still more unfortunate, for they did not go at all.',\n",
       "  \"By ten o'clock the whole party was assembled at the park, where they were to breakfast.\",\n",

       "  '\"On the contrary, nothing can be a stronger proof of it, Elinor; for if there had been any real impropriety in what I did, I should have been sensible of it at the time, for we always know when we are acting wrong, and with such a conviction I could have had no pleasure.\"',\n",
       "  '\"But, my dear Marianne, as it has already exposed you to some very impertinent remarks, do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of your own conduct?\"',\n",
       "  '\"If the impertinent remarks of Mrs. Jennings are to be the proof of impropriety in conduct, we are all offending every moment of our lives. I value not her censure any more than I should do her commendation.  I am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over Mrs. Smith\\'s grounds, or in seeing her house.  They will one day be Mr. Willoughby\\'s, and--\"',\n",
       "  '\"If they were one day to be your own, Marianne, you would not be justified in what you have done.\"',\n",
       "  \"She blushed at this hint; but it was even visibly gratifying to her; and after a ten minutes' interval of earnest thought, she came to her sister again, and said with great good humour,\",\n",
       "  '\"Perhaps, Elinor, it WAS rather ill-judged in me to go to Allenham; but Mr. Willoughby wanted particularly to shew me the place; and it is a charming house, I assure you.--There is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs; of a nice comfortable size for constant use, and with modern furniture it would be delightful.  It is a corner room, and has windows on two sides.  On one side you look across the bowling-green, behind the house, to a beautiful hanging wood, and on the other you have a view of the church and village, and, beyond them, of those fine bold hills that we have so often admired.  I did not see it to advantage, for nothing could be more forlorn than the furniture,--but if it were newly fitted up--a couple of hundred pounds, Willoughby says, would make it one of the pleasantest summer-rooms in England.\"',\n",
       "  'Could Elinor have listened to her without interruption from the others, she would have described every room in the house with equal delight.',\n",
       "  \"The sudden termination of Colonel Brandon's visit at the park, with his steadiness in concealing its cause, filled the mind, and raised the wonder of Mrs. Jennings for two or three days; she was a great wonderer, as every one must be who takes a very lively interest in all the comings and goings of all their acquaintance.\",\n",
       "  'She wondered, with little intermission what could be the reason of it; was sure there must be some bad news, and thought over every kind of distress that could have befallen him, with a fixed determination that he should not escape them all.',\n",
       "  '\"Something very melancholy must be the matter, I am sure,\" said she.',\n",
       "  '\"I could see it in his face.  Poor man!  I am afraid his circumstances may be bad.  The estate at Delaford was never reckoned more than two thousand a year, and his brother left everything sadly involved.  I do think he must have been sent for about money matters, for what else can it be?  I wonder whether it is so.  I would give anything to know the truth of it.  Perhaps it is about Miss Williams and, by the bye, I dare say it is, because he looked so conscious when I mentioned her.  May be she is ill in town; nothing in the world more likely, for I have a notion she is always rather sickly.',\n",
       "  'I would lay any wager it is about Miss Williams.  It is not so very likely he should be distressed in his circumstances NOW, for he is a very prudent man, and to be sure must have cleared the estate by this time.',\n",

       "  'May be his sister is worse at Avignon, and has sent for him over.  His setting off in such a hurry seems very like it.',\n",
       "  'Well, I wish him out of all his trouble with all my heart, and a good wife into the bargain.\"',\n",
       "  'So wondered, so talked Mrs. Jennings.',\n",
       "  'Her opinion varying with every fresh conjecture, and all seeming equally probable as they arose.',\n",
       "  'Elinor, though she felt really interested in the welfare of Colonel Brandon, could not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly away, which Mrs. Jennings was desirous of her feeling; for besides that the circumstance did not in her opinion justify such lasting amazement or variety of speculation, her wonder was otherwise disposed of.',\n",
       "  'It was engrossed by the extraordinary silence of her sister and Willoughby on the subject, which they must know to be peculiarly interesting to them all.',\n",
       "  'As this silence continued, every day made it appear more strange and more incompatible with the disposition of both.',\n",
       "  'Why they should not openly acknowledge to her mother and herself, what their constant behaviour to each other declared to have taken place, Elinor could not imagine.',\n",
       "  'She could easily conceive that marriage might not be immediately in their power; for though Willoughby was independent, there was no reason to believe him rich.',\n",
       "  'His estate had been rated by Sir John at about six or seven hundred a year; but he lived at an expense to which that income could hardly be equal, and he had himself often complained of his poverty.',\n",
       "  'But for this strange kind of secrecy maintained by them relative to their engagement, which in fact concealed nothing at all, she could not account; and it was so wholly contradictory to their general opinions and practice, that a doubt sometimes entered her mind of their being really engaged, and this doubt was enough to prevent her making any inquiry of Marianne.',\n",
       "  \"Nothing could be more expressive of attachment to them all, than Willoughby's behaviour.\",\n",
       "  \"To Marianne it had all the distinguishing tenderness which a lover's heart could give, and to the rest of the family it was the affectionate attention of a son and a brother.\",\n",
       "  'The cottage seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home; many more of his hours were spent there than at Allenham; and if no general engagement collected them at the park, the exercise which called him out in the morning was almost certain of ending there, where the rest of the day was spent by himself at the side of Marianne, and by his favourite pointer at her feet.',\n",
       "  \"One evening in particular, about a week after Colonel Brandon left the country, his heart seemed more than usually open to every feeling of attachment to the objects around him; and on Mrs. Dashwood's happening to mention her design of improving the cottage in the spring, he warmly opposed every alteration of a place which affection had established as perfect with him.\",\n",
       "  '\"What!\" he exclaimed--\"Improve this dear cottage!  No. THAT I will never consent to.  Not a stone must be added to its walls, not an inch to its size, if my feelings are regarded.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Do not be alarmed,\" said Miss Dashwood, \"nothing of the kind will be done; for my mother will never have money enough to attempt it.\"',\n",
       "  '\"I am heartily glad of it,\" he cried.',\n",
       "  '\"May she always be poor, if she can employ her riches no better.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Thank you, Willoughby.  But you may be assured that I would not sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours, or of any one whom I loved, for all the improvements in the world.  Depend upon it that whatever unemployed sum may remain, when I make up my accounts in the spring, I would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose of it in a manner so painful to you.  But are you really so attached to this place as to see no defect in it?\"',\n",
       "  '\"I am,\" said he.',\n",
       "  '\"To me it is faultless.  Nay, more, I consider it as the only form of building in which happiness is attainable, and were I rich enough I would instantly pull Combe down, and build it up again in the exact plan of this cottage.\"',\n",
       "  '\"With dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes, I suppose,\" said Elinor.',\n",
       "  '\"Yes,\" cried he in the same eager tone, \"with all and every thing belonging to it;--in no one convenience or INconvenience about it, should the least variation be perceptible.  Then, and then only, under such a roof, I might perhaps be as happy at Combe as I have been at Barton.\"',\n",
       "  '\"I flatter myself,\" replied Elinor, \"that even under the disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase, you will hereafter find your own house as faultless as you now do this.\"',\n",
       "  '\"There certainly are circumstances,\" said Willoughby, \"which might greatly endear it to me; but this place will always have one claim of my affection, which no other can possibly share.\"',\n",
       "  'Mrs. Dashwood looked with pleasure at Marianne, whose fine eyes were fixed so expressively on Willoughby, as plainly denoted how well she understood him.',\n",
       "  '\"How often did I wish,\" added he, \"when I was at Allenham this time twelvemonth, that Barton cottage were inhabited!  I never passed within view of it without admiring its situation, and grieving that no one should live in it.  How little did I then think that the very first news I should hear from Mrs. Smith, when I next came into the country, would be that Barton cottage was taken: and I felt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event, which nothing but a kind of prescience of what happiness I should experience from it, can account for.  Must it not have been so, Marianne?\"',\n",

       "  'and this dear parlour in which our acquaintance first began, and in which so many happy hours have been since spent by us together, you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance, and every body would be eager to pass through the room which has hitherto contained within itself more real accommodation and comfort than any other apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the world could possibly afford.\"',\n",
       "  'Mrs. Dashwood again assured him that no alteration of the kind should be attempted.',\n",
       "  '\"You are a good woman,\" he warmly replied.',\n",
       "  '\"Your promise makes me easy.  Extend it a little farther, and it will make me happy.  Tell me that not only your house will remain the same, but that I shall ever find you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling; and that you will always consider me with the kindness which has made everything belonging to you so dear to me.\"',\n",
       "  \"The promise was readily given, and Willoughby's behaviour during the whole of the evening declared at once his affection and happiness.\",\n",

       "  \"Mrs. Dashwood's visit to Lady Middleton took place the next day, and two of her daughters went with her; but Marianne excused herself from being of the party, under some trifling pretext of employment; and her mother, who concluded that a promise had been made by Willoughby the night before of calling on her while they were absent, was perfectly satisfied with her remaining at home.\",\n",
       "  \"On their return from the park they found Willoughby's curricle and servant in waiting at the cottage, and Mrs. Dashwood was convinced that her conjecture had been just.\",\n",
       "  'So far it was all as she had foreseen; but on entering the house she beheld what no foresight had taught her to expect.',\n",
       "  'They were no sooner in the passage than Marianne came hastily out of the parlour apparently in violent affliction, with her handkerchief at her eyes; and without noticing them ran up stairs.',\n",
       "  'Surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room she had just quitted, where they found only Willoughby, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his back towards them.',\n",
       "  'He turned round on their coming in, and his countenance shewed that he strongly partook of the emotion which over-powered Marianne.',\n",
       "  '\"Is anything the matter with her?\" cried Mrs. Dashwood as she entered--\"is she ill?\"',\n",
       "  '\"I hope not,\" he replied, trying to look cheerful; and with a forced smile presently added, \"It is I who may rather expect to be ill--for I am now suffering under a very heavy disappointment!\"',\n",
       "  '\"Disappointment?\"',\n",
       "  '\"Yes, for I am unable to keep my engagement with you.  Mrs. Smith has this morning exercised the privilege of riches upon a poor dependent cousin, by sending me on business to London.  I have just received my dispatches, and taken my farewell of Allenham; and by way of exhilaration I am now come to take my farewell of you.\"',\n",
       "  '\"To London!--and are you going this morning?\"',\n",
       "  '\"Almost this moment.\"',\n",

       "  '\"And is Mrs. Smith your only friend?  Is Allenham the only house in the neighbourhood to which you will be welcome?  For shame, Willoughby, can you wait for an invitation here?\"',\n",
       "  'His colour increased; and with his eyes fixed on the ground he only replied, \"You are too good.\"',\n",
       "  'Mrs. Dashwood looked at Elinor with surprise.',\n",
       "  'Elinor felt equal amazement.',\n",

       "  '\"I have only to add, my dear Willoughby, that at Barton cottage you will always be welcome; for I will not press you to return here immediately, because you only can judge how far THAT might be pleasing to Mrs. Smith; and on this head I shall be no more disposed to question your judgment than to doubt your inclination.\"',\n",
       "  '\"My engagements at present,\" replied Willoughby, confusedly, \"are of such a nature--that--I dare not flatter myself\"--',\n",
       "  'He stopt.',\n",
       "  'Mrs. Dashwood was too much astonished to speak, and another pause succeeded.',\n",
       "  'This was broken by Willoughby, who said with a faint smile, \"It is folly to linger in this manner.  I will not torment myself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it is impossible for me now to enjoy.\"',\n",
       "  'He then hastily took leave of them all and left the room.',\n",
       "  'They saw him step into his carriage, and in a minute it was out of sight.',\n",
       "  'Mrs. Dashwood felt too much for speech, and instantly quitted the parlour to give way in solitude to the concern and alarm which this sudden departure occasioned.',\n",
       "  \"Elinor's uneasiness was at least equal to her mother's.\",\n",
       "  'She thought of what had just passed with anxiety and distrust.',\n",
       "  \"Willoughby's behaviour in taking leave of them, his embarrassment, and affectation of cheerfulness, and, above all, his unwillingness to accept her mother's invitation, a backwardness so unlike a lover, so unlike himself, greatly disturbed her.\",\n",
       "  \"One moment she feared that no serious design had ever been formed on his side; and the next that some unfortunate quarrel had taken place between him and her sister;--the distress in which Marianne had quitted the room was such as a serious quarrel could most reasonably account for, though when she considered what Marianne's love for him was, a quarrel seemed almost impossible.\",\n",
       "  \"But whatever might be the particulars of their separation, her sister's affliction was indubitable; and she thought with the tenderest compassion of that violent sorrow which Marianne was in all probability not merely giving way to as a relief, but feeding and encouraging as a duty.\",\n",
       "  'In about half an hour her mother returned, and though her eyes were red, her countenance was not uncheerful.',\n",
       "  '\"Our dear Willoughby is now some miles from Barton, Elinor,\" said she, as she sat down to work, \"and with how heavy a heart does he travel?\"',\n",
       "  '\"It is all very strange.  So suddenly to be gone! It seems but the work of a moment.  And last night he was with us so happy, so cheerful, so affectionate?  And now, after only ten minutes notice--Gone too without intending to return!--Something more than what he owned to us must have happened.  He did not speak, he did not behave like himself.',\n",
       "  'YOU must have seen the difference as well as I.  What can it be?  Can they have quarrelled?  Why else should he have shewn such unwillingness to accept your invitation here?\"--',\n",
       "  '\"It was not inclination that he wanted, Elinor; I could plainly see THAT.  He had not the power of accepting it.  I have thought it all over I assure you, and I can perfectly account for every thing that at first seemed strange to me as well as to you.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Can you, indeed!\"',\n",
       "  '\"Yes. I have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way;--but you, Elinor, who love to doubt where you can--it will not satisfy YOU, I know; but you shall not talk ME out of my trust in it.  I am persuaded that Mrs. Smith suspects his regard for Marianne, disapproves of it, (perhaps because she has other views for him,) and on that account is eager to get him away;--and that the business which she sends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him. This is what I believe to have happened.  He is, moreover, aware that she DOES disapprove the connection, he dares not therefore at present confess to her his engagement with Marianne, and he feels himself obliged, from his dependent situation, to give into her schemes, and absent himself from Devonshire for a while.',\n",
       "  'You will tell me, I know, that this may or may NOT have happened; but I will listen to no cavil, unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affair as satisfactory at this.  And now, Elinor, what have you to say?\"',\n",
       "  '\"Nothing, for you have anticipated my answer.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Then you would have told me, that it might or might not have happened. Oh, Elinor, how incomprehensible are your feelings!  You had rather take evil upon credit than good.  You had rather look out for misery for Marianne, and guilt for poor Willoughby, than an apology for the latter.  You are resolved to think him blameable, because he took leave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour has shewn.  And is no allowance to be made for inadvertence, or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment?  Are no probabilities to be accepted, merely because they are not certainties?',\n",
       "  'Is nothing due to the man whom we have all such reason to love, and no reason in the world to think ill of?',\n",
       "  'To the possibility of motives unanswerable in themselves, though unavoidably secret for a while?',\n",
       "  'And, after all, what is it you suspect him of?\"',\n",
       "  '\"I can hardly tell myself.  But suspicion of something unpleasant is the inevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessed in him.  There is great truth, however, in what you have now urged of the allowances which ought to be made for him, and it is my wish to be candid in my judgment of every body.  Willoughby may undoubtedly have very sufficient reasons for his conduct, and I will hope that he has. But it would have been more like Willoughby to acknowledge them at once.  Secrecy may be advisable; but still I cannot help wondering at its being practiced by him.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Do not blame him, however, for departing from his character, where the deviation is necessary.  But you really do admit the justice of what I have said in his defence?--I am happy--and he is acquitted.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Not entirely.  It may be proper to conceal their engagement (if they ARE engaged) from Mrs. Smith--and if that is the case, it must be highly expedient for Willoughby to be but little in Devonshire at present.  But this is no excuse for their concealing it from us.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Concealing it from us! my dear child, do you accuse Willoughby and Marianne of concealment? This is strange indeed, when your eyes have been reproaching them every day for incautiousness.\"',\n",
       "  '\"I want no proof of their affection,\" said Elinor; \"but of their engagement I do.\"',\n",
       "  '\"I am perfectly satisfied of both.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Yet not a syllable has been said to you on the subject, by either of them.\"',\n",
       "  '\"I have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly.  Has not his behaviour to Marianne and to all of us, for at least the last fortnight, declared that he loved and considered her as his future wife, and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation? Have we not perfectly understood each other?  Has not my consent been daily asked by his looks, his manner, his attentive and affectionate respect?',\n",
       "  'My Elinor, is it possible to doubt their engagement?  How could such a thought occur to you?  How is it to be supposed that Willoughby, persuaded as he must be of your sister\\'s love, should leave her, and leave her perhaps for months, without telling her of his affection;--that they should part without a mutual exchange of confidence?\"',\n",
       "  '\"I confess,\" replied Elinor, \"that every circumstance except ONE is in favour of their engagement; but that ONE is the total silence of both on the subject, and with me it almost outweighs every other.\"',\n",
       "  '\"How strange this is!  You must think wretchedly indeed of Willoughby, if, after all that has openly passed between them, you can doubt the nature of the terms on which they are together.  Has he been acting a part in his behaviour to your sister all this time?  Do you suppose him really indifferent to her?\"',\n",
       "  '\"No, I cannot think that.  He must and does love her I am sure.\"',\n",
       "  '\"But with a strange kind of tenderness, if he can leave her with such indifference, such carelessness of the future, as you attribute to him.\"',\n",
       "  '\"You must remember, my dear mother, that I have never considered this matter as certain.  I have had my doubts, I confess; but they are fainter than they were, and they may soon be entirely done away.  If we find they correspond, every fear of mine will be removed.\"',\n",
       "  '\"A mighty concession indeed!  If you were to see them at the altar, you would suppose they were going to be married.  Ungracious girl!  But I require no such proof.  Nothing in my opinion has ever passed to justify doubt; no secrecy has been attempted; all has been uniformly open and unreserved.  You cannot doubt your sister\\'s wishes.  It must be Willoughby therefore whom you suspect.  But why?  Is he not a man of honour and feeling? Has there been any inconsistency on his side to create alarm? can he be deceitful?\"',\n",
       "  '\"I hope not, I believe not,\" cried Elinor.',\n",
       "  '\"I love Willoughby, sincerely love him; and suspicion of his integrity cannot be more painful to yourself than to me.  It has been involuntary, and I will not encourage it.  I was startled, I confess, by the alteration in his manners this morning;--he did not speak like himself, and did not return your kindness with any cordiality.  But all this may be explained by such a situation of his affairs as you have supposed.  He had just parted from my sister, had seen her leave him in the greatest affliction; and if he felt obliged, from a fear of offending Mrs. Smith, to resist the temptation of returning here soon, and yet aware that by declining your invitation, by saying that he was going away for some time, he should seem to act an ungenerous, a suspicious part by our family, he might well be embarrassed and disturbed.  In such a case, a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been more to his honour I think, as well as more consistent with his general character;--but I will not raise objections against any one\\'s conduct on so illiberal a foundation, as a difference in judgment from myself, or a deviation from what I may think right and consistent.\"',\n",
       "  '\"You speak very properly.  Willoughby certainly does not deserve to be suspected.  Though WE have not known him long, he is no stranger in this part of the world; and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage? Had he been in a situation to act independently and marry immediately, it might have been odd that he should leave us without acknowledging everything to me at once: but this is not the case.  It is an engagement in some respects not prosperously begun, for their marriage must be at a very uncertain distance; and even secrecy, as far as it can be observed, may now be very advisable.\"',\n",

       "  '\"Why do you not ask Marianne at once,\" said she, \"whether she is or she is not engaged to Willoughby?  From you, her mother, and so kind, so indulgent a mother, the question could not give offence.  It would be the natural result of your affection for her.  She used to be all unreserve, and to you more especially.\"',\n",
       "  '\"I would not ask such a question for the world.  Supposing it possible that they are not engaged, what distress would not such an enquiry inflict!  At any rate it would be most ungenerous.  I should never deserve her confidence again, after forcing from her a confession of what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one.  I know Marianne\\'s heart: I know that she dearly loves me, and that I shall not be the last to whom the affair is made known, when circumstances make the revealment of it eligible.  I would not attempt to force the confidence of any one; of a child much less; because a sense of duty would prevent the denial which her wishes might direct.\"',\n",
       "  \"Elinor thought this generosity overstrained, considering her sister's youth, and urged the matter farther, but in vain; common sense, common care, common prudence, were all sunk in Mrs. Dashwood's romantic delicacy.\",\n",

We will put it by, that when he comes again...But it may be months, perhaps, before THAT happens.\"',\n",

       "  'If her sisters intended to walk on the downs, she directly stole away towards the lanes; if they talked of the valley, she was as speedy in climbing the hills, and could never be found when the others set off.',\n",
       "  'But at length she was secured by the exertions of Elinor, who greatly disapproved such continual seclusion.',\n",
       "  \"They walked along the road through the valley, and chiefly in silence, for Marianne's MIND could not be controlled, and Elinor, satisfied with gaining one point, would not then attempt more.\",\n",
       "  'Beyond the entrance of the valley, where the country, though still rich, was less wild and more open, a long stretch of the road which they had travelled on first coming to Barton, lay before them; and on reaching that point, they stopped to look around them, and examine a prospect which formed the distance of their view from the cottage, from a spot which they had never happened to reach in any of their walks before.',\n",
       "  'Amongst the objects in the scene, they soon discovered an animated one; it was a man on horseback riding towards them.',\n",

       "  '\"Indeed, Marianne, I think you are mistaken.  It is not Willoughby. The person is not tall enough for him, and has not his air.\"',\n",
       "  '\"He has, he has,\" cried Marianne, \"I am sure he has.  His air, his coat, his horse.  I knew how soon he would come.\"',\n",
       "  'She walked eagerly on as she spoke; and Elinor, to screen Marianne from particularity, as she felt almost certain of its not being Willoughby, quickened her pace and kept up with her.',\n",

       "  \"Marianne looked again; her heart sunk within her; and abruptly turning round, she was hurrying back, when the voices of both her sisters were raised to detain her; a third, almost as well known as Willoughby's, joined them in begging her to stop, and she turned round with surprise to see and welcome Edward Ferrars.\",\n",
       "  \"He was the only person in the world who could at that moment be forgiven for not being Willoughby; the only one who could have gained a smile from her; but she dispersed her tears to smile on HIM, and in her sister's happiness forgot for a time her own disappointment.\",\n",

       "  \"On Edward's side, more particularly, there was a deficiency of all that a lover ought to look and say on such an occasion.\",\n",
       "  'He was confused, seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure in seeing them, looked neither rapturous nor gay, said little but what was forced from him by questions, and distinguished Elinor by no mark of affection.',\n",
       "  'Marianne saw and listened with increasing surprise.',\n",
       "  'She began almost to feel a dislike of Edward; and it ended, as every feeling must end with her, by carrying back her thoughts to Willoughby, whose manners formed a contrast sufficiently striking to those of his brother elect.',\n",
       "  'After a short silence which succeeded the first surprise and enquiries of meeting, Marianne asked Edward if he came directly from London.',\n",
       "  'No, he had been in Devonshire a fortnight.',\n",
       "  '\"A fortnight!\" she repeated, surprised at his being so long in the same county with Elinor without seeing her before.',\n",

       "  '\"Dear, dear Norland,\" said Elinor, \"probably looks much as it always does at this time of the year.  The woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Oh,\" cried Marianne, \"with what transporting sensation have I formerly seen them fall!  How have I delighted, as I walked, to see them driven in showers about me by the wind!  What feelings have they, the season, the air altogether inspired!  Now there is no one to regard them.  They are seen only as a nuisance, swept hastily off, and driven as much as possible from the sight.\"',\n",
       "  '\"It is not every one,\" said Elinor, \"who has your passion for dead leaves.\"',\n",
       "  '\"No; my feelings are not often shared, not often understood.  But SOMETIMES they are.\"--As she said this, she sunk into a reverie for a few moments;--but rousing herself again,',\n",
       "  '\"Now, Edward,\" said she, calling his attention to the prospect, \"here is Barton valley.  Look up to it, and be tranquil if you can.  Look at those hills!  Did you ever see their equals?  To the left is Barton park, amongst those woods and plantations.  You may see the end of the house.  And there, beneath that farthest hill, which rises with such grandeur, is our cottage.\"',\n",
       "  '\"It is a beautiful country,\" he replied; \"but these bottoms must be dirty in winter.\"',\n",
       "  '\"How can you think of dirt, with such objects before you?\"',\n",
       "  '\"Because,\" replied he, smiling, \"among the rest of the objects before me, I see a very dirty lane.\"',\n",
       "  '\"How strange!\" said Marianne to herself as she walked on.',\n",
       "  '\"Have you an agreeable neighbourhood here?  Are the Middletons pleasant people?\"',\n",
       "  '\"No, not all,\" answered Marianne; \"we could not be more unfortunately situated.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Marianne,\" cried her sister, \"how can you say so? How can you be so unjust?  They are a very respectable family, Mr. Ferrars; and towards us have behaved in the friendliest manner.  Have you forgot, Marianne, how many pleasant days we have owed to them?\"',\n",
       "  '\"No,\" said Marianne, in a low voice, \"nor how many painful moments.\"',\n",
       "  'Elinor took no notice of this; and directing her attention to their visitor, endeavoured to support something like discourse with him, by talking of their present residence, its conveniences, &c. extorting from him occasional questions and remarks.',\n",
       "  'His coldness and reserve mortified her severely; she was vexed and half angry; but resolving to regulate her behaviour to him by the past rather than the present, she avoided every appearance of resentment or displeasure, and treated him as she thought he ought to be treated from the family connection.',\n",
       "  'Mrs. Dashwood was surprised only for a moment at seeing him; for his coming to Barton was, in her opinion, of all things the most natural.',\n",
       "  'Her joy and expression of regard long outlived her wonder.',\n",
       "  'He received the kindest welcome from her; and shyness, coldness, reserve could not stand against such a reception.',\n",
       "  'They had begun to fail him before he entered the house, and they were quite overcome by the captivating manners of Mrs. Dashwood.',\n",
       "  'Indeed a man could not very well be in love with either of her daughters, without extending the passion to her; and Elinor had the satisfaction of seeing him soon become more like himself.',\n",
       "  'His affections seemed to reanimate towards them all, and his interest in their welfare again became perceptible.',\n",
       "  'He was not in spirits, however; he praised their house, admired its prospect, was attentive, and kind; but still he was not in spirits.',\n",
       "  'The whole family perceived it, and Mrs. Dashwood, attributing it to some want of liberality in his mother, sat down to table indignant against all selfish parents.',\n",
       "  '\"What are Mrs. Ferrars\\'s views for you at present, Edward?\" said she, when dinner was over and they had drawn round the fire; \"are you still to be a great orator in spite of yourself?\"',\n",
       "  '\"No. I hope my mother is now convinced that I have no more talents than inclination for a public life!\"',\n",
       "  '\"But how is your fame to be established? for famous you must be to satisfy all your family; and with no inclination for expense, no affection for strangers, no profession, and no assurance, you may find it a difficult matter.\"',\n",
       "  '\"I shall not attempt it.  I have no wish to be distinguished; and have every reason to hope I never shall.  Thank Heaven! I cannot be forced into genius and eloquence.\"',\n",
       "  '\"You have no ambition, I well know.  Your wishes are all moderate.\"',\n",
       "  '\"As moderate as those of the rest of the world, I believe.  I wish as well as every body else to be perfectly happy; but, like every body else it must be in my own way.  Greatness will not make me so.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Strange that it would!\" cried Marianne.',\n",
       "  '\"What have wealth or grandeur to do with happiness?\"',\n",
       "  '\"Grandeur has but little,\" said Elinor, \"but wealth has much to do with it.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Elinor, for shame!\" said Marianne, \"money can only give happiness where there is nothing else to give it.  Beyond a competence, it can afford no real satisfaction, as far as mere self is concerned.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Perhaps,\" said Elinor, smiling, \"we may come to the same point.  YOUR competence and MY wealth are very much alike, I dare say; and without them, as the world goes now, we shall both agree that every kind of external comfort must be wanting.  Your ideas are only more noble than mine.  Come, what is your competence?\"',\n",
       "  '\"About eighteen hundred or two thousand a year; not more than THAT.\"',\n",
       "  'Elinor laughed.',\n",
       "  '\"TWO thousand a year! ONE is my wealth! I guessed how it would end.\"',\n",
       "  '\"And yet two thousand a-year is a very moderate income,\" said Marianne.',\n",
       "  '\"A family cannot well be maintained on a smaller.  I am sure I am not extravagant in my demands.  A proper establishment of servants, a carriage, perhaps two, and hunters, cannot be supported on less.\"',\n",
       "  'Elinor smiled again, to hear her sister describing so accurately their future expenses at Combe Magna.',\n",
       "  '\"Hunters!\" repeated Edward--\"but why must you have hunters?  Every body does not hunt.\"',\n",
       "  'Marianne coloured as she replied, \"But most people do.\"',\n",
       "  '\"I wish,\" said Margaret, striking out a novel thought, \"that somebody would give us all a large fortune apiece!\"',\n",
       "  '\"Oh that they would!\" cried Marianne, her eyes sparkling with animation, and her cheeks glowing with the delight of such imaginary happiness.',\n",
       "  '\"We are all unanimous in that wish, I suppose,\" said Elinor, \"in spite of the insufficiency of wealth.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Oh dear!\" cried Margaret, \"how happy I should be!  I wonder what I should do with it!\"',\n",
       "  'Marianne looked as if she had no doubt on that point.',\n",
       "  '\"I should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself,\" said Mrs. Dashwood, \"if my children were all to be rich without my help.\"',\n",
       "  '\"You must begin your improvements on this house,\" observed Elinor, \"and your difficulties will soon vanish.\"',\n",
       "  '\"What magnificent orders would travel from this family to London,\" said Edward, \"in such an event!  What a happy day for booksellers, music-sellers, and print-shops!  You, Miss Dashwood, would give a general commission for every new print of merit to be sent you--and as for Marianne, I know her greatness of soul, there would not be music enough in London to content her.  And books!--Thomson, Cowper, Scott--she would buy them all over and over again: she would buy up every copy, I believe, to prevent their falling into unworthy hands; and she would have every book that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree.  Should not you, Marianne?  Forgive me, if I am very saucy.  But I was willing to shew you that I had not forgot our old disputes.\"',\n",
       "  '\"I love to be reminded of the past, Edward--whether it be melancholy or gay, I love to recall it--and you will never offend me by talking of former times.  You are very right in supposing how my money would be spent--some of it, at least--my loose cash would certainly be employed in improving my collection of music and books.\"',\n",
       "  '\"And the bulk of your fortune would be laid out in annuities on the authors or their heirs.\"',\n",
       "  '\"No, Edward, I should have something else to do with it.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Perhaps, then, you would bestow it as a reward on that person who wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim, that no one can ever be in love more than once in their life--your opinion on that point is unchanged, I presume?\"',\n",
       "  '\"Undoubtedly. At my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed.  It is not likely that I should now see or hear any thing to change them.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Marianne is as steadfast as ever, you see,\" said Elinor, \"she is not at all altered.\"',\n",
       "  '\"She is only grown a little more grave than she was.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Nay, Edward,\" said Marianne, \"you need not reproach me.  You are not very gay yourself.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Why should you think so!\" replied he, with a sigh.',\n",
       "  '\"But gaiety never was a part of MY character.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Nor do I think it a part of Marianne\\'s,\" said Elinor;',\n",
       "  '\"I should hardly call her a lively girl--she is very earnest, very eager in all she does--sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation--but she is not often really merry.\"',\n",
       "  '\"I believe you are right,\" he replied, \"and yet I have always set her down as a lively girl.\"',\n",
       "  '\"I have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes,\" said Elinor, \"in a total misapprehension of character in some point or other: fancying people so much more gay or grave, or ingenious or stupid than they really are, and I can hardly tell why or in what the deception originated.  Sometimes one is guided by what they say of themselves, and very frequently by what other people say of them, without giving oneself time to deliberate and judge.\"',\n",
       "  '\"But I thought it was right, Elinor,\" said Marianne, \"to be guided wholly by the opinion of other people.  I thought our judgments were given us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours.  This has always been your doctrine, I am sure.\"',\n",
       "  '\"No, Marianne, never.  My doctrine has never aimed at the subjection of the understanding.  All I have ever attempted to influence has been the behaviour.  You must not confound my meaning.  I am guilty, I confess, of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance in general with greater attention; but when have I advised you to adopt their sentiments or to conform to their judgment in serious matters?\"',\n",
       "  '\"You have not been able to bring your sister over to your plan of general civility,\" said Edward to Elinor.',\n",
       "  '\"Do you gain no ground?\"',\n",
       "  '\"Quite the contrary,\" replied Elinor, looking expressively at Marianne.',\n",
       "  '\"My judgment,\" he returned, \"is all on your side of the question; but I am afraid my practice is much more on your sister\\'s.  I never wish to offend, but I am so foolishly shy, that I often seem negligent, when I am only kept back by my natural awkwardness.  I have frequently thought that I must have been intended by nature to be fond of low company, I am so little at my ease among strangers of gentility!\"',\n",
       "  '\"Marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention of hers,\" said Elinor.',\n",
       "  '\"She knows her own worth too well for false shame,\" replied Edward.',\n",
       "  '\"Shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or other.  If I could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful, I should not be shy.\"',\n",
       "  '\"But you would still be reserved,\" said Marianne, \"and that is worse.\"',\n",

Do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not talk as fast, and admire what she admires as rapturously as herself?\"',\n",

       "  'It was evident that he was unhappy; she wished it were equally evident that he still distinguished her by the same affection which once she had felt no doubt of inspiring; but hitherto the continuance of his preference seemed very uncertain; and the reservedness of his manner towards her contradicted one moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding one.',\n",
       "  'He joined her and Marianne in the breakfast-room the next morning before the others were down; and Marianne, who was always eager to promote their happiness as far as she could, soon left them to themselves.',\n",

       "  '***',\n",
       "  'Edward returned to them with fresh admiration of the surrounding country; in his walk to the village, he had seen many parts of the valley to advantage; and the village itself, in a much higher situation than the cottage, afforded a general view of the whole, which had exceedingly pleased him.',\n",
       "  'This was a subject which ensured Marianne\\'s attention, and she was beginning to describe her own admiration of these scenes, and to question him more minutely on the objects that had particularly struck him, when Edward interrupted her by saying, \"You must not enquire too far, Marianne--remember I have no knowledge in the picturesque, and I shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste if we come to particulars.  I shall call hills steep, which ought to be bold; surfaces strange and uncouth, which ought to be irregular and rugged; and distant objects out of sight, which ought only to be indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere.  You must be satisfied with such admiration as I can honestly give.  I call it a very fine country--the hills are steep, the woods seem full of fine timber, and the valley looks comfortable and snug--with rich meadows and several neat farm houses scattered here and there.  It exactly answers my idea of a fine country, because it unites beauty with utility--and I dare say it is a picturesque one too, because you admire it; I can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories, grey moss and brush wood, but these are all lost on me.  I know nothing of the picturesque.\"',\n",
       "  '\"I am afraid it is but too true,\" said Marianne; \"but why should you boast of it?\"',\n",
       "  '\"I suspect,\" said Elinor, \"that to avoid one kind of affectation, Edward here falls into another.  Because he believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel, and is disgusted with such pretensions, he affects greater indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses.  He is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own.\"',\n",
       "  '\"It is very true,\" said Marianne, \"that admiration of landscape scenery is become a mere jargon.  Every body pretends to feel and tries to describe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what picturesque beauty was.  I detest jargon of every kind, and sometimes I have kept my feelings to myself, because I could find no language to describe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning.\"',\n",
       "  '\"I am convinced,\" said Edward, \"that you really feel all the delight in a fine prospect which you profess to feel.  But, in return, your sister must allow me to feel no more than I profess.  I like a fine prospect, but not on picturesque principles.  I do not like crooked, twisted, blasted trees.  I admire them much more if they are tall, straight, and flourishing.  I do not like ruined, tattered cottages.  I am not fond of nettles or thistles, or heath blossoms.  I have more pleasure in a snug farm-house than a watch-tower--and a troop of tidy, happy villages please me better than the finest banditti in the world.\"',\n",

       "  'That the hair was her own, she instantaneously felt as well satisfied as Marianne; the only difference in their conclusions was, that what Marianne considered as a free gift from her sister, Elinor was conscious must have been procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself.',\n",
       "  'She was not in a humour, however, to regard it as an affront, and affecting to take no notice of what passed, by instantly talking of something else, she internally resolved henceforward to catch every opportunity of eyeing the hair and of satisfying herself, beyond all doubt, that it was exactly the shade of her own.',\n",

       "  \"Marianne's countenance was more communicative.\",\n",
       "  'Edward saw enough to comprehend, not only the meaning of others, but such of Marianne\\'s expressions as had puzzled him before; and when their visitors left them, he went immediately round her, and said, in a whisper, \"I have been guessing.  Shall I tell you my guess?\"',\n",
       "  '\"What do you mean?\"',\n",
       "  '\"Shall I tell you.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Certainly.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Well then; I guess that Mr. Willoughby hunts.\"',\n",
       "  'Marianne was surprised and confused, yet she could not help smiling at the quiet archness of his manner, and after a moment\\'s silence, said,\"Oh, Edward! How can you?--But the time will come I hope...I am sure you will like him.\"',\n",
       "  '\"I do not doubt it,\" replied he, rather astonished at her earnestness and warmth; for had he not imagined it to be a joke for the good of her acquaintance in general, founded only on a something or a nothing between Mr. Willoughby and herself, he would not have ventured to mention it.',\n",
       "  'Edward remained a week at the cottage; he was earnestly pressed by Mrs. Dashwood to stay longer; but, as if he were bent only on self-mortification, he seemed resolved to be gone when his enjoyment among his friends was at the height.',\n",
       "  'His spirits, during the last two or three days, though still very unequal, were greatly improved--he grew more and more partial to the house and environs--never spoke of going away without a sigh--declared his time to be wholly disengaged--even doubted to what place he should go when he left them--but still, go he must.',\n",
       "  'Never had any week passed so quickly--he could hardly believe it to be gone.',\n",
       "  'He said so repeatedly; other things he said too, which marked the turn of his feelings and gave the lie to his actions.',\n",
       "  'He had no pleasure at Norland; he detested being in town; but either to Norland or London, he must go.',\n",
       "  'He valued their kindness beyond any thing, and his greatest happiness was in being with them.',\n",
       "  'Yet, he must leave them at the end of a week, in spite of their wishes and his own, and without any restraint on his time.',\n",
       "  \"Elinor placed all that was astonishing in this way of acting to his mother's account; and it was happy for her that he had a mother whose character was so imperfectly known to her, as to be the general excuse for every thing strange on the part of her son.\",\n",
       "  \"Disappointed, however, and vexed as she was, and sometimes displeased with his uncertain behaviour to herself, she was very well disposed on the whole to regard his actions with all the candid allowances and generous qualifications, which had been rather more painfully extorted from her, for Willoughby's service, by her mother.\",\n",
       "  \"His want of spirits, of openness, and of consistency, were most usually attributed to his want of independence, and his better knowledge of Mrs. Ferrars's disposition and designs.\",\n",
       "  'The shortness of his visit, the steadiness of his purpose in leaving them, originated in the same fettered inclination, the same inevitable necessity of temporizing with his mother.',\n",
       "  'The old well-established grievance of duty against will, parent against child, was the cause of all.',\n",
       "  'She would have been glad to know when these difficulties were to cease, this opposition was to yield,--when Mrs. Ferrars would be reformed, and her son be at liberty to be happy.',\n",
       "  \"But from such vain wishes she was forced to turn for comfort to the renewal of her confidence in Edward's affection, to the remembrance of every mark of regard in look or word which fell from him while at Barton, and above all to that flattering proof of it which he constantly wore round his finger.\",\n",
       "  '\"I think, Edward,\" said Mrs. Dashwood, as they were at breakfast the last morning, \"you would be a happier man if you had any profession to engage your time and give an interest to your plans and actions.  Some inconvenience to your friends, indeed, might result from it--you would not be able to give them so much of your time.  But (with a smile) you would be materially benefited in one particular at least--you would know where to go when you left them.\"',\n",
       "  '\"I do assure you,\" he replied, \"that I have long thought on this point, as you think now.  It has been, and is, and probably will always be a heavy misfortune to me, that I have had no necessary business to engage me, no profession to give me employment, or afford me any thing like independence.  But unfortunately my own nicety, and the nicety of my friends, have made me what I am, an idle, helpless being.  We never could agree in our choice of a profession.  I always preferred the church, as I still do.  But that was not smart enough for my family. They recommended the army.  That was a great deal too smart for me. The law was allowed to be genteel enough; many young men, who had chambers in the Temple, made a very good appearance in the first circles, and drove about town in very knowing gigs.  But I had no inclination for the law, even in this less abstruse study of it, which my family approved.',\n",
       "  'As for the navy, it had fashion on its side, but I was too old when the subject was first started to enter it--and, at length, as there was no necessity for my having any profession at all, as I might be as dashing and expensive without a red coat on my back as with one, idleness was pronounced on the whole to be most advantageous and honourable, and a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his friends to do nothing.  I was therefore entered at Oxford and have been properly idle ever since.\"',\n",
       "  '\"The consequence of which, I suppose, will be,\" said Mrs. Dashwood, \"since leisure has not promoted your own happiness, that your sons will be brought up to as many pursuits, employments, professions, and trades as Columella\\'s.\"',\n",
       "  '\"They will be brought up,\" said he, in a serious accent, \"to be as unlike myself as is possible.  In feeling, in action, in condition, in every thing.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Come, come; this is all an effusion of immediate want of spirits, Edward.  You are in a melancholy humour, and fancy that any one unlike yourself must be happy.  But remember that the pain of parting from friends will be felt by every body at times, whatever be their education or state.  Know your own happiness.  You want nothing but patience--or give it a more fascinating name, call it hope.  Your mother will secure to you, in time, that independence you are so anxious for; it is her duty, and it will, it must ere long become her happiness to prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent. How much may not a few months do?\"',\n",
       "  '\"I think,\" replied Edward, \"that I may defy many months to produce any good to me.\"',\n",
       "  \"This desponding turn of mind, though it could not be communicated to Mrs. Dashwood, gave additional pain to them all in the parting, which shortly took place, and left an uncomfortable impression on Elinor's feelings especially, which required some trouble and time to subdue.\",\n",
       "  'But as it was her determination to subdue it, and to prevent herself from appearing to suffer more than what all her family suffered on his going away, she did not adopt the method so judiciously employed by Marianne, on a similar occasion, to augment and fix her sorrow, by seeking silence, solitude and idleness.',\n",
       "  'Their means were as different as their objects, and equally suited to the advancement of each.',\n",
       "  'Elinor sat down to her drawing-table as soon as he was out of the house, busily employed herself the whole day, neither sought nor avoided the mention of his name, appeared to interest herself almost as much as ever in the general concerns of the family, and if, by this conduct, she did not lessen her own grief, it was at least prevented from unnecessary increase, and her mother and sisters were spared much solicitude on her account.',\n",
       "  'Such behaviour as this, so exactly the reverse of her own, appeared no more meritorious to Marianne, than her own had seemed faulty to her.',\n",
       "  'The business of self-command she settled very easily;--with strong affections it was impossible, with calm ones it could have no merit.',\n",
       "  \"That her sister's affections WERE calm, she dared not deny, though she blushed to acknowledge it; and of the strength of her own, she gave a very striking proof, by still loving and respecting that sister, in spite of this mortifying conviction.\",\n",
       "  \"Without shutting herself up from her family, or leaving the house in determined solitude to avoid them, or lying awake the whole night to indulge meditation, Elinor found every day afforded her leisure enough to think of Edward, and of Edward's behaviour, in every possible variety which the different state of her spirits at different times could produce,--with tenderness, pity, approbation, censure, and doubt.\",\n",
       "  'There were moments in abundance, when, if not by the absence of her mother and sisters, at least by the nature of their employments, conversation was forbidden among them, and every effect of solitude was produced.',\n",
       "  'Her mind was inevitably at liberty; her thoughts could not be chained elsewhere; and the past and the future, on a subject so interesting, must be before her, must force her attention, and engross her memory, her reflection, and her fancy.',\n",
       "  \"From a reverie of this kind, as she sat at her drawing-table, she was roused one morning, soon after Edward's leaving them, by the arrival of company.\",\n",
       "  'She happened to be quite alone.',\n",
       "  'The closing of the little gate, at the entrance of the green court in front of the house, drew her eyes to the window, and she saw a large party walking up to the door.',\n",
       "  'Amongst them were Sir John and Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings, but there were two others, a gentleman and lady, who were quite unknown to her.',\n",
       "  'She was sitting near the window, and as soon as Sir John perceived her, he left the rest of the party to the ceremony of knocking at the door, and stepping across the turf, obliged her to open the casement to speak to him, though the space was so short between the door and the window, as to make it hardly possible to speak at one without being heard at the other.',\n",
       "  '\"Well,\" said he, \"we have brought you some strangers.  How do you like them?\"',\n",
       "  '\"Hush! they will hear you.\"',\n",
       "  '\"Never mind if they do.  It is only the Palmers.  Charlotte is very pretty, I can tell you.  You may see her if you look this way.\"',\n",
       "  'As Elinor was certain of seeing her in a couple of minutes, without taking that liberty, she begged to be excused.',\n",
       "  '\"Where is Marianne? Has she run away because we are come? I see her instrument is open.\"',\n",
       "  '\"She is walking, I believe.\"',\n",
       "  'They were now joined by Mrs. Jennings, who had not patience enough to wait till the door was opened before she told HER story.',\n",
       "  'She came hallooing to the window,',\n",
       "  '\"How do you do, my dear?  How does Mrs. Dashwood do?  And where are your sisters?',\n",
       "  'What! all alone! you will be glad of a little company to sit with you.  I have brought my other son and daughter to see you.  Only think of their coming so suddenly!',\n",
       "  'I thought I heard a carriage last night, while we were drinking our tea, but it never entered my head that it could be them.',\n",
       "  'I thought of nothing but whether it might not be Colonel Brandon come back again; so I said to Sir John, I do think I hear a carriage; perhaps it is Colonel Brandon come back again\"--',\n",
       "  'Elinor was obliged to turn from her, in the middle of her story, to receive the rest of the party; Lady Middleton introduced the two strangers; Mrs. Dashwood and Margaret came down stairs at the same time, and they all sat down to look at one another, while Mrs. Jennings continued her story as she walked through the passage into the parlour, attended by Sir John.',\n",
       "  'Mrs. Palmer was several years younger than Lady Middleton, and totally unlike her in every respect.  She was short and plump, had a very pretty face, and the finest expression of good humour in it that could possibly be.',\n",
       "  \"Her manners were by no means so elegant as her sister's, but they were much more prepossessing.\",\n",
       "  'She came in with a smile, smiled all the time of her visit, except when she laughed, and smiled when she went away.',\n",
       "  'Her husband was a grave looking young man of five or six and twenty, with an air of more fashion and sense than his wife, but of less willingness to please or be pleased.',\n",
       "  'He entered the room with a look of self-consequence, slightly bowed to the ladies, without speaking a word, and, after briefly surveying them and their apartments, took up a newspaper from the table, and continued to read it as long as he staid.',\n",
       "  'Mrs. Palmer, on the contrary, who was strongly endowed by nature with a turn for being uniformly civil and happy, was hardly seated before her admiration of the parlour and every thing in it burst forth.',\n",
       "  '\"Well! what a delightful room this is! I never saw anything so charming!  Only think, Mama, how it is improved since I was here last! I always thought it such a sweet place, ma\\'am! (turning to Mrs. Dashwood) but you have made it so charming!  Only look, sister, how delightful every thing is! How I should like such a house for myself! Should not you, Mr. Palmer?\"',\n",
       "  'Mr. Palmer made her no answer, and did not even raise his eyes from the newspaper.',\n",
       "  '\"Mr. Palmer does not hear me,\" said she, laughing; \"he never does sometimes.  It is so ridiculous!\"',\n",
       "  'This was quite a new idea to Mrs. Dashwood; she had never been used to find wit in the inattention of any one, and could not help looking with surprise at them both.',\n",
       "  'Mrs. Jennings, in the meantime, talked on as loud as she could, and continued her account of their surprise, the evening before, on seeing their friends, without ceasing till every thing was told.',\n",
       "  'Mrs. Palmer laughed heartily at the recollection of their astonishment, and every body agreed, two or three times over, that it had been quite an agreeable surprise.',\n",
       "  '\"You may believe how glad we all were to see them,\" added Mrs. Jennings, leaning forward towards Elinor, and speaking in a low voice as if she meant to be heard by no one else, though they were seated on different sides of the room; \"but, however, I can\\'t help wishing they had not travelled quite so fast, nor made such a long journey of it, for they came all round by London upon account of some business, for you know (nodding significantly and pointing to her daughter) it was wrong in her situation.  I wanted her to stay at home and rest this morning, but she would come with us; she longed so much to see you all!\"',\n",
       "  'Mrs. Palmer laughed, and said it would not do her any harm.',\n",
       "  '\"She expects to be confined in February,\" continued Mrs. Jennings.',\n",
       "  'Lady Middleton could no longer endure such a conversation, and therefore exerted herself to ask Mr. Palmer if there was any news in the paper.',\n",
       "  '\"No, none at all,\" he replied, and read on.',\n",
       "  '\"Here comes Marianne,\" cried Sir John.',\n",
       "  '\"Now, Palmer, you shall see a monstrous pretty girl.\"',\n",
       "  'He immediately went into the passage, opened the front door, and ushered her in himself.',\n",
       "  'Mrs. Jennings asked her, as soon as she appeared, if she had not been to Allenham; and Mrs. Palmer laughed so heartily at the question, as to show she understood it.',\n",
       "  'Mr. Palmer looked up on her entering the room, stared at her some minutes, and then returned to his newspaper.',\n",
       "  \"Mrs. Palmer's eye was now caught by the drawings which hung round the room.\",\n",
       "  'She got up to examine them.',\n",
       "  '\"Oh! dear, how beautiful these are!  Well! how delightful!  Do but look, mama, how sweet! I declare they are quite charming; I could look at them for ever.\"',\n",
       "  'And then sitting down again, she very soon forgot that there were any such things in the room.',\n",
       "  'When Lady Middleton rose to go away, Mr. Palmer rose also, laid down the newspaper, stretched himself and looked at them all around.',\n",
       "  '\"My love, have you been asleep?\" said his wife, laughing.',\n",
       "  'He made her no answer; and only observed, after again examining the room, that it was very low pitched, and that the ceiling was crooked.',\n",
       "  'He then made his bow, and departed with the rest.',\n",
       "  'Sir John had been very urgent with them all to spend the next day at the park.',\n",
       "  'Mrs. Dashwood, who did not chuse to dine with them oftener than they dined at the cottage, absolutely refused on her own account; her daughters might do as they pleased.',\n",
       "  'But they had no curiosity to see how Mr. and Mrs. Palmer ate their dinner, and no expectation of pleasure from them in any other way.',\n",
       "  'They attempted, therefore, likewise, to excuse themselves; the weather was uncertain, and not likely to be good.',\n",
       "  'But Sir John would not be satisfied--the carriage should be sent for them and they must come.',\n",
       "  'Lady Middleton too, though she did not press their mother, pressed them.',\n",
       "  'Mrs. Jennings and Mrs. Palmer joined their entreaties, all seemed equally anxious to avoid a family party; and the young ladies were obliged to yield.',\n",
       "  '\"Why should they ask us?\" said Marianne, as soon as they were gone.',\n",
       "  '\"The rent of this cottage is said to be low; but we have it on very hard terms, if we are to dine at the park whenever any one is staying either with them, or with us.\"',\n",
       "  '\"They mean no less to be civil and kind to us now,\" said Elinor, \"by these frequent invitations, than by those which we received from them a few weeks ago.  The alteration is not in them, if their parties are grown tedious and dull.  We must look for the change elsewhere.\"',\n",
       "  'As the Miss Dashwoods entered the drawing-room of the park the next day, at one door, Mrs. Palmer came running in at the other, looking as good humoured and merry as before.',\n",
       "  'She took them all most affectionately by the hand, and expressed great delight in seeing them again.',\n",
       "  '\"I am so glad to see you!\" said she, seating herself between Elinor and Marianne, \"for it is so bad a day I was afraid you might not come, which would be a shocking thing, as we go away again tomorrow. We must go, for the Westons come to us next week you know.',\n",
       "  'It was quite a sudden thing our coming at all, and I knew nothing of it till the carriage was coming to the door, and then Mr. Palmer asked me if I would go with him to Barton.  He is so droll! He never tells me any thing! I am so sorry we cannot stay longer; however we shall meet again in town very soon, I hope.\"',\n",
       "  'They were obliged to put an end to such an expectation.',\n",
       "  '\"Not go to town!\" cried Mrs. Palmer, with a laugh, \"I shall be quite disappointed if you do not.  I could get the nicest house in the world for you, next door to ours, in Hanover-square.  You must come, indeed.  I am sure I shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till I am confined, if Mrs. Dashwood should not like to go into public.\"',\n",
